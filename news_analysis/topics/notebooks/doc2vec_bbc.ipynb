Details have emerged of a passenger-plane about to land at Heathrow airport - having had a \"near miss\" with an \"unidentified\" drone. And as Nick Beake reports, pilots are becoming increasingly concerned, about the number of people buying drones this Christmas. Unmanned aircraft have come a long way, they started out in the hands of the few, mostly the military. Now, smallerand of the few, mostly the military. Now, smaller and more Now, smallerand more agile, drones are big business. Used by professionals, the images they capture can be stunning. But airline pilots are worried that spiralling numbers flown by amateurs could put at risk passenger planes. We have had two incidents where people flew these too close to a flight path. There was a near miss at Heathrow. If one of those drones gets into an engine, we could have a serious problem. This week a report will explain how close a joint came to hitting a passenger plane at Heathrow for the first time. It happened onjuly 22 Heathrow for the first time. It happened on july 22 when a plane was at 700 feet on its final approach. It was an Airbus A320 that can carry UP It was an Airbus A320 that can carry up to 180 passengers. The near miss was rated the highest risk of possible collision. Drones have become smaller and lighter and cheaper. Some cost under £100. This retailer reckons they will be a big hit this Christmas. With more people using them, there is concern that not everyone is doing so responsibly. Here, they give out a fact sheet what you can and cannot do under UK law. It is already illegal to use drones near airports and there are concerns over the congested areas. There is concern over this technology that has taken off so quickly. A London Ambulance Service car on an emergency call has crashed into the side of a restaurant in Battersea injuring two paramedics. The rapid response vehicle hit the building on Battersea Bridge Road this morning. No other vehicle was involved. A senior Metropolitan police officer has been arrested on suspicion of dealing Class A drugs. Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the identity of the Chief Inspector, but says he was arrested in south London on suspicion of offences including drink-driving. From today, the Docklands Light Railway is being run by a French state-owned company. It’s caused some anger because British state-owned agencies weren’t even allowed to bid for the contract. Here’s Tim Donovan. From today the Docklands light Railway is to be operated by a consortium consisting of one Spanish company and another company part-owned by the French National Railways. The RMT union says it reflects a worrying trend. The fact of the matter is, 70 out of 71+ of the franchises on our railway network have gone to foreign companies. Actually, foreign national railway companies. transport for London is not allowed to bid for the VOR company itself and some say the odds are stacked against British companies which don’t get access to the same cheap finance as their foreign competitors. They have access to relatively cheap capital. As a government, as our government would. They are allowed to bid for these franchises and take the profits out of the country. But the Conservatives say that bringing private operators in has been successful on the DLR. What matters to me is not so much the ownership of the company or who is operating the railway, so long as they fulfil what set out in the contract, but the quality of the service they provide to customers. Some surveys suggest the public would welcome the renationalisation of the railways. The Conservatives reject the idea, Labour stopped short too but has promised to review the existing franchise system. Time now for the weather forecast with Sara. Good evening, we are looking at a frost as we go through the night, temperaturesjust about holding up above freezing but it will be a cold start to tomorrow. Some showers at first, they clear away quite smartly and the rest of the day is quite dry with spells of sunshine and a noticeable wind. It will feel quite raw with a top temperatures of five to seven Celsius. With a sharp frost on Tuesday morning, generally dry as we go through the day. That’s it from the BBC London weekend team, have a very good night. Good evening. Some heavier showers developing further south. Don’t be surprised to see the odd flake of snow as we go into the early hours. Temperatures kept above freezing because of the strength of the wind but it is going to be a particularly cold start to the new working week. Some clear spells in between. In those clear spells, the risk for the Russia Iowa -- those clear spells, the risk for the Russia Iowa -- rush hour will be ice for some of you. Most of the showers will fade away. Across certain southern areas, the showers will soon disappear. The breeze easing a little bit. Still risk down the eastern coasts. Showers are limited to western Scotland, Northern Ireland, North West England and parts of the Midlands. Out of the wind, it will be even colder. Widespread frosts, temperatures down to -5 in some areas. A brief step into the miles # Like I’ve never seen before... # Isn’t it wonderful? # Even though I love you madly... # Miaow! Hiya, gang. # Happy Christmas! # Prepare to be amazed.

We are now in that crucial month of December, and for our four teams in action tonight, no time to reflect on the season so far, with the fixtures coming thick and fast. john Hartson, Thomas Hitzlsperger and Asmir Begovic provide our company as we look back on another entertaining and contentious day in the Barclays Premier League. First, a match-up between two in-form sides. Both West Ham and Swansea City are enjoying their best ever starts to a Premier League campaign. It was February before West Ham had this many points last season, while Swansea have already beaten the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal this term. You won’t find two more content managers, but will Garry Monk burst big Sam’s bubble? At Upton Park, Steve Bower. Both defying the odds, exceeding expectations. The West Ham boss is able to recall Enner Valencia and Alex Song. Mark Noble is not fit enough to return, but Sakho is back amongst the substitutes. Swansea are without the suspended Neil Taylor, who had started every game until now. Angel Rangel does return, in the only change. Leon Brittan continues in midfield, against the club who once paid ÂlIoo,000 for him as a 16-year-old. Nine home wins from 16 Premier League matches in this calendar year. That is cleared by Williams, only as far as Song. Look at the jenkinson. Four in the penalty area. Muted appeals for handball. And then, untidy challenge. Some uncomfortable moments here for Swansea. Leon Brittan on Downing, which I thought was the bigger shout. Nice work from the West Ham midfield. Kevin Nolan could not find the target. It was the driving run of Kouyate that started it. In came Kevin Nolan. We have seen him put those away over the years. Good possession from Song. And then the foul on Valencia by Richards. Saved by the legs of Fabianski. Tompkins then had a go. Cleared by Routledge. Swansea were almost caught out. Garry Monk took over as interim manager three days after this corresponding fixture last season. It was the last game of Michael Laudrup’s era. They lost 2-0, and that is when he got the call. He has come a long way since then,in call. He has come a long way since then, in a short space of time. Montero. Trying to play the Billy Kee with Sigurdsson. He has managed it... Wilfried Bony! And it is 1-0 Swansea! Beautifully worked, against the run of play, you have to say. But Bony, clinical again, the run of play, you have to say. But Bony, clinicalagain, his seventh goal in nine Premier League games. Montero kept his composure and picked Wilfried Bony out. Swansea’s top scorer did the rest. Well, he admitted before this game, when he signed Andy Carroll, he had the opportunity to bid for Wilfried Bony. But they could not afford '"

The rapid response vehicle hit the building on Battersea Bridge Road this morning. A senior Metropolitan police officer has been arrested on suspicion of dealing Class A drugs. Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the identity of the Chief Inspector, but says he was arrested in south London on suspicion of offences including drink-driving. From today, the Docklands Light Railway is being run by a French state-owned company. It’s caused some anger because British state-owned agencies weren’t even allowed to bid for the contract. From today the Docklands light Railway is to be operated by a consortium consisting of one Spanish company and another company part-owned by the French National Railways. The fact of the matter is, 70 out of 71+ of the franchises on our railway network have gone to foreign companies. transport for London is not allowed to bid for the VOR company itself and some say the odds are stacked against British companies which don’t get access to the same cheap finance as their foreign competitors. They are allowed to bid for these franchises and take the profits out of the country. But the Conservatives say that bringing private operators in has been successful on the DLR. What matters to me is not so much the ownership of the company or who is operating the railway, so long as they fulfil what set out in the contract, but the quality of the service they provide to customers. Some surveys suggest the public would welcome the renationalisation of the railways. The Conservatives reject the idea, Labour stopped short too but has promised to review the existing franchise system. Good evening, we are looking at a frost as we go through the night, temperaturesjust about holding up above freezing but it will be a cold start to tomorrow. Some showers at first, they clear away quite smartly and the rest of the day is quite dry with spells of sunshine and a noticeable wind. It will feel quite raw with a top temperatures of five to seven Celsius. With a sharp frost on Tuesday morning, generally dry as we go through the day. That’s it from the BBC London weekend team, have a very good night. Don’t be surprised to see the odd flake of snow as we go into the early hours. Temperatures kept above freezing because of the strength of the wind but it is going to be a particularly cold start to the new working week.\n",

Garry Monk took over as interim manager three days after this corresponding fixture last season. They lost 2-0, and that is when he got the call.
