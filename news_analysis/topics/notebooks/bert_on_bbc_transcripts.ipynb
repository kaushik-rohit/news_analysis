      "But BUT This BMT This mas his BUT This was his sTuge, stage. But this was his stage, where the one and only Muhammad Ali reigns supreme. I’m of a real champion of the world, do you hear me? This man is a megastar, add some more mega Toure onto that. My only fault is that I don’t realise how great I really am. You don’t like me because my big mouth, that was only publicity. Time flies when you are in good company, don’t it? I think it was the greatest betrayal in Swedish history. Wallander concludes... Tributes are paid around the world to Muhammad Ali, who’s died at the age of 74. I’ll whip any man in the world and I want everybody out there on TV to know it.\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "The way he moved - the speed, the grace, the power- I knew it was something magical. The Kentucky boy rose from humble beginnings to become three-time World Heavyweight Champion.\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "Politically, he was controversial because of his conversion to Islam, his stand on civil rights and his refusal to fight in the Vietnam War. Later, he won global respect for his humanitarian work, but was increasingly frail after a long battle with Parkinson’s disease. Tributes have been paid around the world to Muhammad Ali, who has died at the age of 74. Outspoken, but rarely outfought, Ali transcended the sport of boxing, of which he was three times World Champion. He was politically controversial, dividing opinion after converting to Islam and refusing to fight in Vietnam. President Obama paid tribute saying - \"he shook up the world, and the world is better for it.\" Our North America editor, jon Sopel, is live from his birthplace in Kentucky. Yes, here in Louisville thereby has been a steady procession of people coming to pay their respects. On Wednesday the city will play host to a funeral in which people are expected to fly in from across the country and around the world. In the last couple of hours, Barack Obama has spoken to Muhammad Ali’s widow to express his and the nations donds. If you could bring ballet to boxing, beauty to brawn, Muhammad Ali did it.\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "But amidst all the fooling around, there was a hugely articulate, deeply political individual with an acute sense of injustice. The global superstar wading into two of America’s most divisive issues of the 1960s - the civil rights struggle and the Vietnam War. Cassius Clay, Muhammad Ali, refused to take the American Army oath. I will say directly, no, I will not go 10,000 miles to help kill innocent people.\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "The hero boxer became reviled by the establishment and revered by black America fighting for a better life. Those who were part of that civil rights struggle paid tribute to him today. Ali lived long enough to see those that condemn him praise him. Ali didn’t change, he changed the world because he believed in himself. Those of you of a certain age may remember watching Muhammad Ali dealing with his Parkinson’s disease.\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "Once the most graceful, powerful athlete in the world with his hands shaking, holding on and he did hisjob.\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "Who he was as a person was greater than his legend, which should be all of our goal in life. From President Obama, a tweet of this old photo with the caption - \"He shook up the world, and the world’s better for it. But it’s notjust the good and the great remembering him. In the street where he grew up, I spoke to some of the neighbours who are still there. My family lived in the house next door and he babysat me and my sister and my brother. He stung like a bee and he was a good fighter and he fought all the way to the end, even through his illness. The reach of Muhammad Ali went way beyond sport and reaches beyond the generations. Among the many tributes was one from Muhammad Ali’s great boxing rival, George Foreman, who told the BBC he felt he’s lost a piece of himself. Our sports editor, Dan Roan, looks back at the extraordinary career of The Boxer. I’ll whip any man in the world and I want everybody out there on TV to know it. He could tell you he’d float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, and then he’d do it.\n",
      "---------------------\n",
      "With a speed time and agility never before seen in a heavyweight boxer, Ali was a genius in the ring and a cultural icon out of it. His charisma and his beliefs establishing him as a true superstar who came to transcend sport. Born Cassius Clay, in Lousiville Kentucky in 1942, he first achieved fame when he won Gold at the Rome Olympics in 1960. Three years later, he was famously floored by a left hook from Sir Henry Cooper. Clay was left with a shot at the world title, held by the fiercesome Sonny Liston, a fighter considered invincible. The rank outsider first mocked his opponent and then he beat him. An outspoken force of nature, his brash, boastful antics could be divisive, but the so-called 'Louisville Lip’ was a blisteringly powerful expression of freedom. REPORTER: Why do you insist on being called Muhammad Ali now? That’s the name given to me by my leader and teacher, the honourable Elijah Muhammad. His opposition to the Vietnam War saw him vilified as much as he was admired. He was stripped of his title and sentenced to five years in jail. This was quashed on appeal, but Ali was refused a licence to box. In his prime, his beliefs had cost him more than three years out of the ring. In the 1970s, Ali made some memorable appearances on Sir Michael Parkinson’s chat shows. He’s without doubt the most beautiful and complete athlete I’ve ever seen. To others he’s a political leader, a figurehead in the battle between black-and-white and yet to more people, who care little about sport and even less about politics, he’s one of the world’s great entertainers. He revealed his showmanship and taste for publicity were inspired by an American wrestler, called Gorgeous George. When I saw all of those people coming to see Gorgeous George to get beat and they all paid to get in. I admired him and he had faults, of course he had faults. His memory will live on for the rest of time, I suppose. If one fight defined Ali, it was in Zaire in 1974, his epic battle against the mountainous George Foreman, the Rumble in thejungle. We’re going to prove to the world I’m The Greatest. I’m going to eat some raw meat and I’m going to train. I’m going to get ready and chop some more trees.\n",

      "He spent a year on the road with Ali in the late 1970s and has special memories of a trip to South America where Ali toured hospitals filled with polio victims and lent a helping hand to the poor. Every day that we were there, there were beggars lined up in the hallway and he would... He said, \"because $100 here is worth $10,000 at home.\" Champion, superstar, icon, the superlatives seem inadequate, but his own famous boast also serves as an epitaph. As we’ve been hearing, Ali was a prominent figure both inside and outside of the ring. In the 1960’s he became a leading civil rights activist and his influence on racial equality was felt far beyond the United States, as Elaine Dunkley now reports. NEWS REEL: The colour bar, officially unrecognised in this country... Britain in the 1960s was deeply divided. A colour bar meant new arrivals from the Commonwealth were denied housing and work. It was to America that black Britons would look for cultural icons and they didn’t come much bigger than Muhammad Ali. The black man has been brainwashed and it’s time for him to learn something about his health. Someone like Muhammad Ali came on the scene, you know, he made us feel so good, as young people. He was of great significance for someone like myself, who was involved in radical and revolutionary politics. In1963, activist Paul Stephenson successfully led a campaign to boycott a bus company in Bristol which was refusing to employ black and Asian drivers. The fight for racial equality was the making of a friendship with Muhammad Ali. He wanted to see England follow America in civil rights. We spoke about how we can deal with racism and how he could be used to get England talking about racism. In 1974, Muhammad Ali’s visit to Brixton brought the street to a standstill. Photographer, Neil Kenlock, caught on camera pivotal moments in black British history. You know, it was just fantastic that he decided to leave America to come to Brixton to support our community, and that’s what really touches me.\n",

      "Now to some of the rest of the day’s news. Lord Kinnock said today that the Leave campaign could win the European Union referendum \"by default\" if turnout was low. Along with five other former Labour leaders, he warned a Brexit will happen if Labour voters stayed at home. Elsewhere, Leave campaigners promised more money for public services and control over immigration outside the EU. Well, last time I was campaigning with you I was about that big, 1987 election. A better result would be a win and that’s what the Remain campaign wants, but to do that they must get Labour voters on board, so they’re rolling out the big beasts to win them over. I hope people use their vote to avoid the risk of losing jobs, losing investment. Neil Kinnock may not have won an election, but it’s hoped he’ll appeal to Labour’s core. He attacked Tories in the Leave campaign, saying they’d made false promises about spending EU money. And, on immigration, he had this warning for the Brexit camp. Trying to persuade the British people to sacrifice the great opportunity and the security, economic and otherwise, of being in the European Union, by trying to nourish prejudice, that really is beneath them. Remain campaigners know the Labour vote is crucial to them because many Tories will back Brexit, but Leave campaigners are targeting traditional Labour supporters too by trying to tap into their concerns over immigration. At a rally tonight, they challenged their rivals on the issue. What is your vision for this country if that rate of immigration continues because you have absolutely no way of stopping it. The Leave campaign denied they were making impossible promises about life after Brexit. They unveiled five pledges, again saying EU money could be spent on the NHS and claiming leaving could create 300,000 from new trade deals, but the likelihood of negotiating such deals is disputed. Well, these are what we think we could do if you are able, finally, to do the sorts of free trade deals that are currently prohibited under the EU rules. We haven’t been able to do free trade deals either with India, with China or even with America, one of our biggest trading partners. The challenge for both sides is convincing people their vision of life inside or outside the EU is credible.\n",

Less cloud through the night, retreating to the south-west and Northern Ireland, low cloud to eastern Scotland and north-east England. Partly because there won’t be as much cloud around by tomorrow morning. Any cloud inest earn Scotland and England retreating back to the coast. The cloud will break up in Wales, the south-west and Northern Ireland.\n"
