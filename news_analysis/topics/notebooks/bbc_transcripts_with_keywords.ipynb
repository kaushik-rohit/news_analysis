       "'and the crisp, sunny afternoons, that is what we will get on Wednesday. Not completely dry. There will be one or two showers around. One or two sprinkles flirting with these North Sea coasts. They may be from more northern and eastern Scotland, down into Norwich but the vast majority of the UK will be enjoying that autumn sunshine. Now, high pressure is with us. We’ll talk about this weather front in a second, but high pressure is across the south of the country. It is retreating a bit but still sitting across the south. So that is where we will have the light winds and the frosty weather into Thursday. Thursday morning’s chilly. More of a breeze across the north, so perhaps that frost lifting a bit. So here’s Thursday, still high pressure and dry weather in the south, some sunshine there. But low pressure comes in off the Atlantic and introduces more cloud, outbreaks of rain. This is not milder weather, low pressures often bring milder weather but this one has a lot of chilly weather stuck in it and circling around so I think on Friday, rather than crisp and cold, it’s going to be damp and cold fora lot of us. So cloudy, outbreaks of rain. There’ll be some sunshine around, but for many of us, quite a cloudy day. And look at those temperatures, around eight degrees in Newcastle. This low is going to shift a little bit towards the east and then the isobars come in from the north. So this is where our airstream is coming from. This is the air mass. Remember it’s relative temperature, this does not mean it will be freezing. This is where the mild air is, this is where the colder air is. So we have that northerly, north-easterly wind, bringing those chilly conditions. Lots of shells on Saturday across North Sea coasts and further inland as well. Hail a possibility. Nine degrees, a wind-chill as well. And then on Saturday night, Bonfire Night, it’s not looking too bad. There will be some clear skies around but more of a breeze and a chance of catching some showers, but I think there will be some good conditions around as well. Here’s Sunday, again you can see the air is coming in from the north and north-east. Chilly conditions, it really will be Mickey in Newcastle. And barely into double figures across the south. Let’s see what’s happening in the next week. So we have high pressure towards the south and then these weather fronts try to push in into north-western parts of the UK. You will notice rain here. It all follows the same pattern of the Jet Stream. when we see theJet Stream coming in from the north, that’s when where our air is coming from. So it’s still going to be on the chilly side. Had this Jet stream been further south, going that way, it would have been milder. But this is slightly, not mild air, but slightly less cold air that will be toppling over and the really chilly crisp air will be moving a little bit further towards the east. So not as cold, not as crisp, but still chilly. There will be rain at times throughout the UK but the driest of the weather will remain in the south. Thanks for watching. Everyone stops to watch the car crash, don’t they? The series everyone is talking about... That girl that came back - that was not her. It was not my Alice! No! I mean, it’s interesting to reflect, you made that film five, six years ago and yet today, if one looks at all of the data from the UN and from civic society groups inside Egypt, Egypt of all the countries in the Arab world still has the highest levels of sexual violence against women, why? It’s very complicated. It’s not only one thing. The way we look at women, definitely objectifying women is one thing. I think the film focuses on the shame that is put on women if they reported the case. So silence is the biggest contributor to this pandemic. Has that changed in any way? Even if the stats are still terrible, is there actually more space if you like for women to tell the truth about their experiences? Yes, I can say that when we made the film, there was only one case of sexual harassment in the history of Egypt reported, one case. So now we have hundreds, hundreds of thousands maybe. Women are now, under social media, can see how women and girls are talking about sexual harassment completely different, and how their families and husbands and fiances are thinking differently. I remember some girls, a woman telling me that she took a husband or fiance to the cinema to show them 6, 7, 8, to explain. She couldn’t even dare to talk about it. Through the film. So it’s such a complicated thing. It’s not only one thing. And you have to see the film because the film, for 90 minutes, is trying to explain how things... There is a main character who’s following everything and he’sjust thinking, he sees it from a male point of view, which is a touch. It’s a small touch. It doesn’t. .. Like, Donald Trump, exactly. He doesn’t think this is going to change someone’s life, but it does, and you see that through the film. A lot of this conversation has been about change and how you change people using art, notjust politics. You are not a politician, you’re an artist. I hate politics. You hate politics? Absolutely. But let’s reflect on politics. You talked about the activism that you engaged in inJanuary 2011 and beyond, the Tahrir revolution, where we all were moved by what we saw on our TV screens. And yet here we are five and a half years later, there’s a former General in power, the most extraordinary repression, which has seen thousands and thousands of people locked up for speaking out. Do you actually believe that anything was achieved by that Tahrir uprising? I think it’s very wrong to look at a particular time and say, the effect of things stop here. If we did the same thing with the French Revolution, after three years of the French Revolution, we would say it failed. Would people now say it failed? No. But the stability was achieved after 75 years. They brought the dictator three times. Three times, they brought an Emperor back. And so we can’tjust freeze a moment in time and say the effect today. The effect of today is bad, but I think people are willing to change. We have a new generation that is aspiring for a new world, a new life, a better life. Freedom of speech, democracy for everyone. Until now, since five years, they haven’t been in power, by the way. There isn’t a single person who has really, someone who believed in democracy who is in power in Egypt yet. But would you admit you were wildly optimistic back in those golden days? 100%. So naive! Because, you know, I remember you went up to receive a Webby Award - one of the big global internet awards - on behalf of the Egyptian people, because of all of the activism you’d done and social media. And you said then, you said, \"Injustice plus oppression, plus social media, equals revolution\". Yes. Well, you know, so much for that! I’m learning and growing, and l was naive, definitely. As I told you before, what we thought was just like democracy’s going to be easy once the dictator is out. No, actually, what we need to fight more than the dictator and the regime is ourselves. Most oppression right now is not coming from the military regime, it’s coming from the people who, right now, are actually completely aware of what’s going on. And a final thought. You talk about your own personal journey and no longer being naive. The danger is that you become jaded, you become resigned and weary. One of the leaders of the April 6th protest movement said the other day, when he was talking about whether there could be a new revolt, because they’re talking about getting mass protests going on in Egypt, he said, \"No, forget about it.\" Egypt -- Egyptians, he said, are too tired and too divided to revolt today. Do you think that’s true? I think it is true, but things are changing so fast and so rapidly. The past six months, the Egyptian currency lost 50% of its value. Idon’t think anything matters except the economy. No-one cares anymore about human rights. No-one cares any more about torture. No-one cares any more about democracy. We care about one thing, Egyptians, we care about one thing, which is the economy. The economy is growing to the worst place that we ever saw in our lives, and I can see from the people around me who used to support the regime that things are not going so well. And by the way, from someone who believes in the revolution 100%, a revolution is a medical operation. There is a better way and a way which we all wish that we don’t go to a medical operation, which is pills. Any kind of medication. And that’s reform. So we wish and pray for reform before the next revolution, which is going to be a bloody revolution, and everyone around me that I know is escaping the country fearing that day. We have to end there. It’s a bleak thought to end on but, Mohamed Diab, I thank you very much for being on HARDtalk. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello there. We have lost the mild weather, the foggy mornings, and the rather grey days. We say hello to the colder days with sunshine and a return to frosty mornings. During the night most places will be clear. Cloud clearing from the south. A few showers affecting northern Scotland and maybe Northern Ireland and northern and western Wales. Under clear skies for most of us, chilly first thing on Wednesday morning. Widespread frost in rural areas with temperatures below freezing. Maybe -2, -4 degrees in Scottish Glens. Wednesday starts on a cold note. Plenty of sunshine around. Some showers affecting the northern quarter of Scotland and the Northern Isles. Maybe the odd heavy one mixed in. Plenty of sunshine here. Temperatures in low single figures for most. Maybe the odd shower. A patch of cloud for Northern Ireland. Largely dry otherwise with sunny spells. Same for Wales. Certainly, the bulk of Wales and the majority of England starting sunny but cold with temperatures in the low single figures. Through the day, many places enjoying a fine and dry day with lots of sunshine around. A keen wind. A keen wind in northern and eastern areas. It should be dry with a few showers here but most places should stay dry and it will be a chilly day compared to recent days. Nine until maybe 11-12 degrees in the south. It will be a cold night on Wednesday and a cold morning on Thursday. Widespread frost for most of us because Northern Ireland will have a low pressure area. Elsewhere, dry. Plenty of sunshine in central and eastern Hm! Cloud will begin as the weather system pushes through. Another cold today. 7- 11- 12 degrees in the south. Friday, that rain spreads on to the south-east. Low pressure pretty much dominating the scene on Friday and into the start of Saturday. As that goes to the east we opened the floodgates As that goes to the east we open the floodgates again to a northerly winds and fairly tight isobars mean it will be cold and windy as well. There will be sunshine in the forecast. It is not going to be a washout. We will not see a lot of showers. But quite a few in northern and eastern areas. The odd heavy one. I think the best of the dry and bright weather further south and west. But it is going to feel cold in the northerly winds. 7-10 degrees. A few showers again in the northern and eastern coast. But still, a lot of sunshine. I’m Babita Sharma, in London. This is Newsday. The headlines: Strong resistance, but Iraqi forces finally push inside Mosul. Our correspondent is on the front line. Rocket propelled grenades have been incoming. South Korea’s political scandal - now the president replaces the PM. I’m Rico Hizon, in Singapore. As the polls narrow, with just one week to go, how will the US election affect security in Japan? And remember this picture? We speak to the man who took it, about the campaign to free his subject from charges of fraud. Live from studio is in London and Singapore, this is BBC World News. Singapore, this is BBC World News. It’s Newsday. It’s 1am here in London and 9am in Singapore, and 4am in Iraq, where two years after the humiliation of being driven out by the so-called Islamic State, government forces have finally re-entered the city of Mosul. The offensive is now in its third week. It involves pushing hundreds of troops in heavily-armoured vehicles, tanks and bulldozers towards Iraq’s second largest city. Forces entered the eastern suburb of Kukjali, encountering strong resistance from IS fighters along the way. Our correspondent Ian Pannell and cameraman Darren Conway are on the front line, from where they sent this report. To the east, the warm glow of an autumn morning in Iraq. The dawn of a new day built on the hope of a brighter future. But to the west, a reminder of the bloodshed and madness that has cursed this country for years. The sky over Mosul. The troops have just advanced closer to the city of Mosul. We have heard a whizzing sound overhead which is the sound of sniper fire or certain gunfire coming in from Islamic State and the troops have just come down, they are now trying to respond and stop the shooting coming in. Few expected they would advance this far, this fast. But the closer they get to Mosul, so the resistance only grows. Even so, the war machine rolls on, relentlessly. Thousands of soldiers slowly taking back the land of the so-called caliphate. And in the face of an advancing army, with only a simple piece of white cloth to defend themselves, more than a million people, trapped between two warring sides. This is the moment Iraqi troops finally entered Mosul. It’s taken almost 2.5 years to get here and the so-called Islamic State was waiting for them. 0n the skyline, we saw two suspected fighters, barely aware that the troops were advancing. And then this... Four militants run across the alley. Armed and dangerous, ready to defend the city and to fight to the death. And that’s what’s happened. Nothing short of all-out war. It’s hard to overstate how dangerous today was. A brutal, terrifying battle that will shape the future of Iraq and the threat of Islamic State to the world. The counterterrorism forces have been moving through Mosul, the outskirts only, for the last few hours, and they’ve met incredibly stiff resistance. We have seen a number of ISIS fighters moving around, carrying rocket repel grenades, there have been incoming attacks... RAPID GUNFIRE ..and a lot of gunfire. The ground...the ground is treacherous. It is laced with IEDs and itjust illustrates how hard and difficult this final stage of the battle is going to be. This is just day one inside Mosul. This is the road the troops must now take, straight to the city centre. A dark and dangerous journey into the heart of the caliphate of Islamic State. Ian Pannell, BBC News, Mosul. Let’s take a look at some of the day’s other news. China has shown off its long-awaited J-20 stealth fighterjets in public for the first time. The fifth-generation warplane looks similar to the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, in service with the US Military. Its development is part of Beijing’s push to modernise and upgrade its military capabilities. The BBC has been told by a senior source that the Crown Prince of Thailand will be confirmed as the new king on Decemberfirst, after a full period of mourning has been observed. Once he becomes king, he is expected to endorse a military-drafted constitution, and to start appointing a team of royal officials. The UK Government will spend $2.3 billion over the next four years, on measures to protect the country from cyber-attacks. It comes as the UK’s spy chief accused Russia of using hackers to advance its foreign policy abroad. The Kremlin has dismissed the allegations, calling them unfounded. There have been intense exchanges of fire between India and Pakistan in the disputed region of Kashmir. The two sides have accused each other of around 16 killings in cross-border violence since Monday. The chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir has appealed to both governments to de-escalate the situation. Dramatic pictures - a state of emergency has been declared in the US state of Alabama, after an explosion and fire shut down a pipeline supplying gasoline to millions of people. One person was killed and several others injured. The pipeline, which supplies the east coast of the US with one-third of its petrol, is now closed. Within the last hour South Korea’s president Park Geun-Hye has replaced her Prime Minister and finance minister. It’s her latest bid to contain a damaging political scandal surrounding the President and her close friend. What more do we know about these major (\\'abinet What more do we know about these major Cabinet changes? We don’t know major cabinet changes? We don’t know very much at all. major Cabinet changes?

But we don’t really know, and I don’t expect the know, and I don’t expect the political complexion of the political complexion of the government around the president to government around the president to change. There is a habit in this change. There is a habit in this country of the president is changing country of the president is changing the people around her in times of the people around her in times of crisis. It happened for example crisis. It happened for example after a previous crisis, the sinking after a previous crisis, the sinking of the ferry. In fact, the outgoing of the ferry. In fact, the outgoing Prime Minister now was the incoming Prime Minister now was the incoming Prime Minister after that. The Prime Minister after that.

Thanks so much for finance minister. Thanks so much for the update. There’s less than a week to go before America elects a new president and the polls show the race is tightening. On Tuesday, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were shuttling across the country visiting key battleground states. Mr Trump focused his rally speech on healthcare, while Mrs Clinton spoke about her opponent’s attitude to women. If you’ve got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president, who insults more than half the population of the United States of America... And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to. when we win on November eight... CHEERING AND APPLAUSE ..and elect a Republican Congress, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare. Have to do it. Well, it’s notjust in the US where the outcome of this election will have an impact. InJapan, they are watching closely to see what it will mean for the alliance between the two countries. Since World War II the US has had tens of thousands of troops in Japan. But Donald Trump says that should end.

Still to come on the programme: We’ll hear all about the human library - and what it does - which has opened up right here in Singapore. Also on the programme: We speak to photographer Steve McCurry, who took this famous image in the ‘805, about his fight to get Sharbat Gula freed from fraud charges. Indira Gandhi, ruler of the world’s largest democracy, died today. Only yesterday she’d spoken of dying in the service of her country and said, \"I would be proud of it, every drop of my blood would contribute to the growth of this nation\". After 46 years of unhappiness, these two countries have concluded a chapter of history. No more suspicion, no more fear, no more uncertainty of what each day might bring. Booster ignition and liftoff of Discovery, with a crew of six astronaut heroes and one American legend. Enjoying the show is right. This is beautiful. A milestone in human history. Born today, this girl in India is the 7 billionth person on the planet. This is Newsday on the BBC. Glad you are staying with us. I’m Rico Hizon, in Singapore. And I’m Babita Sharma, in London. Our top stories: The first government-backed Iraqi forces enter Mosul, the last stronghold of self-styled Islamic State in the country. South Korea’s president has named a South Korea’s president has named a new South Korea’s president has named a new Prime Minister. |t South Korea’s president has named a new Prime Minister. It is the latest new Prime Minister. It is the latest twist in a scandal gripping the twist in a scandal gripping the nation. A Chinese Muslim’s call for Alibaba to rename one of its services because it uses the word ‘pig’ has sparked a backlash in China. Some are asking if this meant China had to expunge all references to pigs in popular culture and literature. That story is popular on BBC.com across Asia. Let’s take a look at some front pages from around the world. The China Daily has an update on the Zhuhai international air show, which runs all this week. Today’s report focuses on the C-919 passenger aircraft, seen as China’s attempt to take on the likes of Boeing and Airbus. The picture on the front page of the Philippine Star is from a ceremony marking All Saints’ Day, but lower down is this story about the US decision to stop the sale of assault weapons to the Philippines. Finally, the Straits Times is keeping an eye on Mount Sinabung, on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The volcano began erupting on Sunday. Authorities have closed an area of more than 100 square kilometres around the mountain. Now, Rico, what stories are sparking discussions online? The mystery of why coach loads of Chinese tourists have been travelling to the English village of Kidlington has been solved. The visitors have been turning up in droves and taking photos - even though Kidlington in Oxfordshire is a fairly unremarkable place. Apparently the village, with its neat houses and gardens, represents - for the Chinese - the essence of England. I’m sure I’m surel I’m sure I will visit that place one I’m sure I will visit that place one of these days. It was the photo that became a symbol of the suffering of Afghan people fleeing a war ravaging their country in the 19805. This haunting image of 12-year-old Sharbat Gula went round the world when it was published on the cover of National Geographic magazine in 1984. This is Sharbat Gula now - pictured after being arrested in Pakistan, accused of holding fake identity papers. She could face a fine and up to 11+ years injail if found guilty. The photographer who took that image, Steve McCurry, has called the arrest \"an egregious violation of her human rights.\" A decision is due on Wednesday on whether to release her on bail. Earlier I spoke to Mr McCurry and asked him for his reaction to Sharbat Gula’s arrest. I think that for more than two decades, Sharbat Gula was the face of Afghan refugees. And now she is becoming the symbol of unwanted migrants. I think that the charges against her, we have to... She needs to be... We need to get a lawyer. We need some defence. We need to see what the charges are. We need to see if there is truth in what they say. We need to know they are not going tojust keep her locked up. They don’t tell us when they are going to release her. She is a young girl that is an orphan and is a refugee, she got married and lost her husband, her daughter died recently, she has had a very tragic life. I think the right thing to do, I think the humanitarian thing to do, is to be understanding. They raided her home. They did that as if she was some kind of common criminal. And they divulged that she had cash. I am sure she had some savings. They discourage that. -- described. I think it was really handled in a kind of a shabby way. And I am hoping that, mm, moving forward, we can get some answers and she can get some council. -- we can get some answers and she can get some counsel. 0K. Well, we should tell viewers that the arrest of Sharbat Gula came after Pakistani officers were cracking down on those without legal identity cards. That is what she faces. It is the image you took back in 1984 that propelled her onto a world stage. Do you feel a level of responsibility to her? Well, l have this connection with her and a friendship. We stayed in touch for 11+ years. Up until now we have been helping her in every possible way and will continue to do that. Moving forward, if she wants to move back to Afghanistan, another country, if they allow her to stay in Pakistan, we will help her and support her in every possible way. Do you feel a level of responsibility to her? I do. I think that the photograph has in a way changed her life and | always hoped it would be for the better. I still feel, moving forward, we always helped her with her children’s education. All along the way and in every possible way we have been there at her side. So we will continue to do that like any friend, and I want to help her as much as I can. \\'R Do you think you can help are now? Do you think you ran help are now?

But how much do you know about the concept of a human library? One of these just popped up right here in Singapore. The difference - the stories are not merely printed on paper. Instead, they are spoken by people, encountered while inside. MUSIC PLAYS Any one of us is subjected to stereotypes and any of us can be human books. As long as you are willing and able to tell your stories and answer questions. l was dating a Catholic girl. When the idea formed in my head that maybe I should become a Catholic priest, breaking this idea to her, well, I don’t know how you can bring this idea to anyone. The day ljoined the order, there were a lot of tears shed. Even looking back now, sometimes you feel a bit... But we both learned a lot, I think, from the experience. I had many questions. Am I different? Am I imperfect? Is there something wrong with me? There was a bit of struggle when l was younger. Now on a day-to-day basis I have overcome it and realised nothing like that matters. It doesn’t matter how people view me. I am who lam.

We will be looking in more depth at that airshow in China, as the country gears up to overtake the US as the world’s top aviation market in the next ten years. And before we go, let’s take a look at these pictures. A newborn baby rhino has been having a bath with its mum for the first time. This little creature soon gets into the spirit of it all and has a great time. Thank you forjoining us. Goodbye. Hello there. We have lost the mild weather, the foggy mornings, and the rather grey days. We say hello to the colder days with sunshine and a return to frosty mornings. During the night, most places will be clear. Cloud clearing from the south. A few showers affecting northern Scotland and maybe Northern Ireland and northern and western Wales. Under clear skies for most of us, chilly first thing on Wednesday morning. Widespread frost in rural areas with temperatures below freezing. Maybe -2, -4 degrees in some of the Scottish Glens. Wednesday starts on a cold note. Plenty of sunshine around. Some showers affecting the northern quarter of Scotland and the Northern Isles. Maybe the odd heavy one mixed in. Plenty of sunshine here. Temperatures in low single figures for most. Maybe the odd shower. A patch of cloud for Northern Ireland. Largely dry otherwise with sunny spells. Same for Wales. Certainly, the bulk of Wales and the majority of England starting sunny but cold with temperatures in the low single figures. Through the day, many places enjoying a fine and dry day with lots of sunshine around. A keen wind in northern and eastern areas. It should be dry with a few showers here but most places should stay dry and it will be a chilly day compared to recent days. 9 to maybe 11-12 degrees in the south. It will be a cold night on Wednesday and a cold morning on Thursday. Widespread frost for most of us because Northern Ireland will have a low pressure area. Elsewhere, dry. Plenty of sunshine in central and eastern areas. Cloud will thicken as the weather system pushes through. Another cold today. 7-11 or 12 degrees in the south. Friday, that rain spreads into the south-east. Low pressure pretty much dominating the scene on Friday and into the start of Saturday. As that moves to the east we open the floodgates again to a northerly wind and fairly tight isobars, so it will be cold and windy as well. There will be sunshine in the forecast. It is not going to be a washout. We will not see a lot of showers. But quite a few in northern and eastern areas. The odd heavy one. I think the best of the dry and bright weather further south and west. But it is going to feel cold in the northerly winds. 7-10 degrees. A few showers across the northern and eastern coast. But still, a lot of sunshine. I’m Babita Sharma, with BBC News. Our top story: The first Iraqi forces enter Mosul, the last stronghold of the self-styled Islamic State in the country.

Britain faces a growing threat of cyber attack organised by hostile states, criminal gangs or hackers. That the announcement from the Chancellor who also says that plans Chancellor who also says that plans to improve cyber security will take to improve cyber security will take place. Philip Hammond said Britain needed the capacity to strike back at its cyber enemies. Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones has the details. We know our computers are under threat, we’re getting used to the idea that our phones might not be secure, now we may have to worry about the kettle being hacked. It might sound trivial, but internet connected devices, from domestic appliances to web cams, are giving new openings to global hackers bent on causing serious damage. It punches a hole through your fire wall. This very brand of home CCTV setup was hijacked in last month’s major attack which took down sites like Twitter and Netflix, a taste of what’s to come. These things are so insecure, they’re starting to be turned against us. They’re starting to be used to attack parts of the internet, to take down critical infrastructures.

Inter have sacked head coach Frank de Boer afterjust 85 days in charge. The club are 13 points adrift of Serie A leadersJuventus in 12th place, and are bottom of their group in the Europa League.

Opener Kraigg Brathwaite was the hero for the West Indies as he made an unbeaten 142 to put in them a strong position to beat Pakistan in the third and final test in Sharjah. The tourists have already lost the series, but Brathwaite spent more than eight hours at the crease to lead the tourists to 337 in theirfirst innings. He became just the fifth Windies batsman to carry his bat through a completed test innings. In reply, Jason Holder took three wickets for just ten runs, including Younis Khan, who only lasted five balls as Pakistan closed on 87-4 - a second innings lead of 31. Meanwhile, rain halted play on day four in Harare, while Sri Lanka were extending their lead over Zimbabwe. Having bowled the hosts out for 373, Sri Lanka were 247-6 at stumps in their second innings - a lead of 411 runs. Canada’s Milos Raonic is through to the third round of the Paris Masters after defeating Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta 7-6, 6-4 on Tuesday. The fourth seed, who made the final of this event two years ago, fired off 16 aces and had won both their previous encounters. He’ll next play either 16th seeded Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas or Italy’s Paolo Lorenzi. Tomas Berdych survived a scare, beating Portugal’sjoao Sousa in the second round over three sets. The win takes the Czech through to the third round against either Gilles Simon or Roberto Bautista-Agut, and keeps alive his hopes of making it to the ATP World Tour Finals later this month. But he needs to reach the semi-finals in Paris to have any chance of qualifying. Twelfth seed Richard Gasquet set up a third round encounter with Jack Sock at the Paris Masters on Tuesday following a straight sets win over Sock’s American compatriot Steve Johnson, which featured an extraordinary tie-break going the way of the Frenchman by 13-11. John lsner’s through to the second round. The American served 14 aces as he beat Mischa Zverev in straight sets. Isner saved the only break point he faced in the first, and broke the German’s serve early in the second to take the victory. He’ll play 15th seed David Ferrer next. It is known as ‘the race which stops the nation’, and it certainly came to a dramatic conclusion, as Almandin beat Heartbreak City to win the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday. Battling down the final straight, the two horses were neck-and-neck - Almandin just taking it on the line to win by a long head in the 156th edition of the race. It gives owner Lloyd Williams a record fifth victory in Australia’s richest horse race, and jockey Kerrin McEvoy his second win in the 2-mile classic, his last coming 16 years ago. {[1 Hejust had a dream run, and Lloyd He just had a dream um, and ond has prepared Hejust had a dream run, and Lloyd has prepared him great.

We have lost the mild weather, the foggy mornings, and the rather grey days. We say hello to the colder days with sunshine and a return to frosty mornings. with sunshine and a return During the night, most places will be clear. Cloud clearing from the south. A few showers affecting northern Scotland and maybe Northern Ireland and northern and western Wales. Under clear skies for most of us, chilly first thing on Wednesday morning. Widespread frost in rural areas with temperatures below freezing. Maybe -2, -4 degrees in some of the Scottish Glens. Wednesday starts on a cold note. Plenty of sunshine around. Some showers affecting the northern quarter of Scotland and the Northern Isles. Maybe the odd heavy one mixed in. Plenty of sunshine here. Temperatures in low single figures for most. Maybe the odd shower. A patch of cloud for Northern Ireland. Largely dry otherwise with sunny spells. Same for Wales. Certainly, the bulk of Wales and the majority of England starting sunny but cold with temperatures in the low single figures. Through the day, many places enjoying a fine and dry day with lots of sunshine around. A keen wind in northern and eastern areas. It should be dry with a few showers here but most places should stay dry and it will be a chilly day compared to recent days. 9 to maybe 11-12 degrees in the south. It will be a cold night on Wednesday and a cold morning on Thursday. Widespread frost for most of us because Northern Ireland and Scotland will have a low pressure area. Feeling cold because the winds will be strong. Outbreaks of rain as be strong. Outbreaks of rain as well. Elsewhere, dry. Plenty of sunshine in central and eastern areas. Cloud will thicken as the weather system pushes through. Another cold today. 7-11 or 12 degrees in the south. Friday, that rain spreads into the south-east. Low pressure pretty much dominating the scene on Friday and into the start of Saturday. As that moves to the east we open the floodgates again to a northerly wind and fairly tight isobars, so it will be cold and windy as well. There will be sunshine in the forecast. It is not going to be a washout. We will not see a lot of showers. But quite a few in northern and eastern areas. The odd heavy one. I think the best of the dry and bright weather further south and west. But it is going to feel cold in the northerly winds. 7-10 degrees. Into Sunday, a few showers across the northern and eastern coast. But still, a lot of sunshine. A very warm welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers in North America and around the globe. My name’s Mike Embley. Our top stories: Strong resistance, but Iraqi forces finally push inside Mosul. Our correspondent is on the front line. Rocket propelled grenades have been in coming for a Rocket propelled grenades have been in coming fora long time. One week to go, and Hillary Clinton tries to change the topic from her e-mails to Donald Trump’s attitude to women. In turn, he is focussing on policy, saying one of his first priorities would be the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. And why the death of a fish-seller in Morocco has prompted huge protests, and the arrests of two police officers. Hello. We begin with Iraq, where two years after the humiliation of being driven out by so-called \"Islamic State,\" government-backed forces have finally entered the city of Mosul. The offensive is now in its third week. It involves pushing hundreds of troops in heavily-armoured vehicles, tanks, and bulldozers towards Iraq’s second largest city. Forces entered the eastern suburb of Gangali, encountering strong resistance from IS fighters along the way. Our correspondent, Ian Pannell, and cameraman Darren Conway are on the front line, from where they sent this report. To the east, the warm glow of an autumn morning in Iraq. The dawn of a new day built on the hope of a brighter future. But to the west, a reminder of the bloodshed and madness that has cursed this country for years. The sky over Mosul. The troops have just advanced closer to the city of Mosul. We have heard a whizzing sound overhead which is the sound of sniper fire or certain gunfire coming in from Islamic State and the troops have just come down, they are now trying to respond and stop the shooting coming in. Few expected they would advance this far, this fast. But the closer they get to Mosul, so the resistance only grows. Even so, the war machine rolls on, relentlessly. Thousands of soldiers slowly taking back the land of the so-called caliphate. and in the face of an advancing army with only a simple piece of white cloth to defend themselves, more than a million people, trapped between two warring sides. This is the moment Iraqi troops finally entered Mosul. It’s taken almost 2.5 years to get here and the so-called Islamic State was waiting for them. 0n the skyline, we saw two suspected fighters, barely aware that the troops were advancing. And then this... Four militants run across the alley. Armed and dangerous, ready to defend the city and to fight to the death. And that’s what’s happened. Nothing short of all-out war. It’s hard to overstate how dangerous today was. A brutal, terrifying battle that will shape the future of Iraq and the threat of Islamic State to the world. The counterterrorism forces have been moving through Mosul, the outskirts only, for the last few hours, and they’ve met incredibly stiff resistance. We have seen a number of ISIS fighters moving around, carrying rocket repel grenades, there have been incoming attacks... RAPID GUNFIRE. ..and a lot of gunfire. The ground... The ground is treacherous. It is laced with IEDs and itjust illustrates how hard and difficult this final stage of the battle is going to be. This is just day one inside Mosul. This is the road the troops must now take, straight to the city centre. A dark and dangerous journey into the heart of the caliphate of Islamic State. Ian Pannell, BBC News, Mosul. Mosul is home to more than a million people, who’ve been living under IS control for the last two years. IS has banned satellite dishes and mobile phones, making communication with the outside world difficult. But some residents have risked their lives to make contact with a radio station in Northern Iraq. Our correspondent Orla Guerin has been listening in to their calls. Iraqi troops are inside the city. They have stepped onto the soil of They have stepped onto the soil of Mosul for the first time in 2.5 Mosul for the first time in 2.5 years. This is a symbolic moment for years. This is a symbolic moment for Iraq and also for the people of the Iraq and also for the people of the besieged city who have been waiting besieged city who have been waiting so long for the forces to come to so long for the forces to come to their aid. The so long for the forces to come to theiraid. The Iraqi so long for the forces to come to their aid. The Iraqi troops, the their aid. The Iraqi troops, the counterterrorism forces, they led counterberrorism forces, they led the counterterrorism forces, they led the advance. They went through the the advance. They went through the eastern suburbs and pushed into a eastern suburbs and pushed into a second suburb and managed to take second suburb and managed to take control of a TV station, a symbolic control of a TV station, a symbolic step. Iraqi generals have faced step. Iraqi generals have faced fierce resistance. There was sniper fierce resistance. There was sniper fire. Also there were laserguided fire. Also there were laserguided missiles. We understand that the missiles. We understand that the Iraqi troops are constructing Iraqi troops are constructing concrete walls around there concrete walls around there advancing forces, putting those in advancing forces, putting those in position to try to block the advance position to try to block the advance of Islamic State suicide bombers, of Islamic State suicide bombers, which have been such a feature in which have been such a feature in the last few weeks. We understand the last few weeks. We understand the fighting has finished, forces the fighting has finished, forces have stopped advancing. You can see have stopped advancing. You ran see a have stopped advancing. You can see a sandstorm came up inside Mosul. a sandstorm came up inside Mosul. Iraqi generals are describing this Iraqi generals are describing this as the beginning of the true as the beginning of the true liberation of Mosul. And | as the beginning of the true liberation of Mosul. And I think the liberation of Mosul. And I think the key word there is beginning. In a week’s time, America will be electing a new President. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have been shuttling across the country, visiting key battleground states in the race for votes. Our North America editor, Jon Sopel, reports on the two campaigns in the final stretch. All our Presidents! Wow, whoa! Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both launched their campaigns injune, June 2015 that is, and they have been going at it ever since. Now there is just one week to go. CHEERING. This is where the marathon turns into a sprint as the candidates hurtle around campaigning in the handful of states that will determine selection. They are the key swing states of Florida and North Carolina in the south and Ohio and Pennsylvania in the industrial north. For Donald Trump to have a path to victory, he needs to win all four but successive polls suggest Hillary Clinton has comfortable leads in both North Carolina and Pennsylvania. And that is why in the race for the keys to the White House, Donald Trump may have momentum but Hillary Clinton is still ahead where she needs to be. The key battleground of Florida played host to Hillary Clinton again today. No mention of e-mails, she wanted to turn the attention back to Donald Trump and his suitability for high office. If you have a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president, who insults more than half the population of the United States of America. And what about our boys? This is not someone we, we want them looking up to. But will the latest e-mail scandal hurt her in those key swing states? All politicians have mixups, I think she is doing her best to be honest. I still trust her. I really think this is hurting her, especially so close to the election. I think there’s a ready been a lot of doubt, really, this whole campaign season. This isn’t helping anything. And that is what Donald Tmmp is hoping for. He was in Pennsylvania today, talking policy. In particular, his plan to repeal and replace the health reforms introduced by Barack Obama. It will be such an honour for me, for you and for everybody in this country because ObamaCare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. But for some of the electorate, these pledges may not make a difference. In many states, early voting has already started. It is estimated around 24 million Americans have already voted. That’s about 20% of the likely turnout, and the figures of registered Republicans and Democrats going to vote shows a slight edge for Hillary Clinton. In trying to explain this race, American political pundits have started to use the phrase of the British Prime Ministerfrom the 19605. Harold Wilson’s comments that a week is a long time in politics. In this helter-skelter white knuckle ride, indeed it is and who knows what’s going to happen next. Jon Sopel, BBC News, Washington. Our correspondent, Laura Trevelyan, joins us from Washington.

Just go to bbc.com/news. Stay with us on BBC News. Still to come: Why the race for the White House may have serious security implications forJapan. Indira Gandhi, ruler of the world’s largest democracy, died today. Only yesterday she’d spoken of dying in the service of her country and said, \"I would be proud of it, every drop of my blood would contribute to the growth of this nation\". After 46 years of unhappiness, these two countries have concluded a chapter of history. No more suspicion, no more fear, no more uncertainty of what each day might bring. Booster ignition and liftoff of Discovery, with a crew of six astronaut heroes and one American legend. Enjoying the show is right. This is beautiful. A milestone in human history. Born today, this girl in India is the 7 billionth person on the planet. This is BBC News. My name’s Mike Embley. The latest headlines: The first government-backed Iraqi forces enter Mosul - the last stronghold of self-styled Islamic State in the country. There’s one week to go until the US presidential election - with opinion polls suggesting the race is tightening. In Japan they are watching closely to see what it will mean for the alliance between the two countries. Since World War II the US has had tens of thousands of troops in Japan. But Donald Trump says that should end. The BBC’s Rupert Wingfield-Hayes has been to the island of Okinawa for this report. 15 US fighterjets roar into the sky on the Japanese island of Okinawa. For 70 years this little island in the far south of Japan has been America’s unsinkable aircraft carrier in Asia. I’m now standing on the south-west coast of Okinawa. This beside me is the East China Sea. If you take the drone up... That, off to the west, is the giant Kadena Air Base, the largest US air force facility in the Western Pacific. And if we take the drone to the north, on top of that hill is the Marine Corps base. The US presence here on Okinawa is enormous and, as Donald Trump likes to remind us, it is also extremely expensive. There are nearly 50,000 US personnel based inJapan and another 25,000 Japanese working on these US bases. In the first presidential debate, MrTrump said: This man is chairman of the Okinawa forces labour union. Does he think they are getting a free ride on the US taxpayer? TRANSLATION: Trump has no clue. The Japanese government is paying to lease these areas. Japan also pays the salaries of all the Japanese working on US bases in Okinawa. It even pays the electricity and water bills. Japan pays around US$2 billion every year towards the cost of keeping American forces here. A lot of people in Okinawa want that to stop. These protesters are blocking a truck from getting to a construction site fora new US base. They say the burden of hosting so many US troops here is just too high. So does that mean they support Donald Trump? TRANSLATION: Mr Trump makes lots of radical comments and even talks about removing all the US bases from Okinawa.

You might have thought it was a man’s world then. But even in those pioneering days, women were a vital part of running the Service - on screen, and behind the scenes. Jane Hill has been to meet some of the women involved in the early years of television. ARCHIVE: The controllers are ready on vision, and sound. Women played a key role in these early broadcasts from Alexandra Pa kace. # 0n mystic magic rain #. And not only in front of the camera, nearly half the pay roll was female, working in a new experimental medium. There were executive women, far more than one might think in those days, but then the Corporation was far seeing in those days. Many women were employed as secretaries, but were asked to do a lot more. ARCHIVE: I’m going to hand you over to the... Working as producers and technicians in entertainment and in news, which came from here in Studio A. This is now being refurbished as part of a huge project to showcase the birthplace of television to the public. Lois Singer and Olive Trevet worked at Ally Pally as it’s affectionally known in the late 19405 and 19505. Junior staff learnt on the job. I had experience of that by being given a camera, script and a stopwatch. The day before the programme went out, and to be told by the person who had handed it to me, \"you can do the programme tomorrow.\" Olive operated the tellyprompter for news bulletins and needed special permission to wear trousers at work. We weren’t allowed to wear what we liked. We weren’t allowed to wear what we liked. We had to, you know, always wear skirts to work. You couldn’t wear, you know, slacks, that was unheard of. But it’s ridiculous now, when you think about it. These weren’t the only problems. The first female camera operator, Bimby Harris, spoke of being frozen out by male colleagues and as TV became established more men saw its opportunities. I think as television became more professionalised as well perhaps there was a sense it was a more attractive career for men to take up and so those very early days, the almost gender parity of the early days here at Alexandra Palace started to kind of slip away really I think in relation to that. But 80 years ago women played as important a role as men in this fledgling industry. Jane Hill, BBC News, at Alexandra Palace. And before we go, let’s take a look at these pictures from Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines in Iowa. A new born baby Rhino has been having a bath with its mum for the first time.

And you can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter, I’m @bbcmikeembley. Hello there. We have lost the mild weather, the foggy mornings, and the rather grey days. We say hello to the colder days with sunshine and a return to frosty mornings. During the night most places will be clear. Cloud clearing from the south. A few showers affecting northern Scotland and maybe Northern Ireland and northern and western Wales. Under clear skies for most of us, chilly first thing on Wednesday morning. Widespread frost in rural areas with temperatures below freezing. Maybe -2, -4 degrees in some of the Scottish Glens. Wednesday starts on a cold note. Plenty of sunshine around. Some showers affecting the northern quarter of Scotland and the Northern Isles. Maybe the odd heavy one mixed in. Plenty of sunshine here. Temperatures in low single figures for most. Maybe the odd shower. A patch of cloud for Northern Ireland. Largely dry otherwise with sunny spells. Same for Wales. Certainly, the bulk of Wales and the majority of England starting sunny but cold with temperatures in the low single figures. Through the day, many places enjoying a fine and dry day with lots of sunshine around. A keen wind in northern and eastern areas. It should be dry with a few showers here but most places should stay dry and it will be a chilly day compared to recent days. Nine until maybe 11-12 degrees in the south. It will be a cold night on Wednesday and a cold morning on Thursday. Widespread frost for most of us because Northern Ireland will have a low pressure area. Elsewhere, dry. Plenty of sunshine in central and eastern Hm! Cloud will begin as the weather system pushes through. Another cold today. 7- 11- 12 degrees in the south. Friday, that rain spreads on to the south-east. Low pressure pretty much dominating the scene on Friday and into the start of Saturday. As that goes to the east we open the floodgates again to a northerly winds and fairly tight isobars mean it will be cold and windy as well. There will be sunshine in the forecast. It is not going to be a washout. We will not see a lot of showers. But quite a few in northern and eastern areas. The odd heavy one. I think the best of the dry and bright weather further south and west. But it is going to feel cold in the northerly winds. 7-10 degrees. A few showers again in the northern and eastern coast. But still, a lot of sunshine. My name’s Mike Embley. The latest headlines from BBC News: Iraqi government forces have been fighting in the outskirts of Mosul, entering the city for the first time since \"Islamic State\" militants captured it more than two years ago. There were fierce clashes all through the day. The advancing troops were targeted with rockets, mortars and machine-gun fire. There’s one week to go until the US Presidential Election, and both candidates are on the campaign trail. Hillary Clinton has been attacking Donald Trump for his attitude towards women.

The fishmonger was crushed to death in a rubbish truck, as he tried to retrieve fish confiscated by police. Now it’s time for a look back at the day in Parliament. Hello and welcome to Tuesday in Parliament, our look at the best of the day in the Commons and the Lords. On this programme... The Government is to \"take stock\" before going ahead with a second stage of the inquiry into press regulation. Labour calls it a sad day. In effect, she is today announcing a consultation on whether the cover-up should be covered up. Are the public hood-winked by claims and counter claims in referendums? You’re misleading them with an atrocious lie. That’s what this... We are encouraging them to vote... You’re hopelessly misleading them. The vote was about improving the quality of our democracy... And the momenta peer who hails from north of the border gave a message Glasgow-style. Would it be appropriate to say to these people... \\'Haud your whist’? But first... The Government is to hold a10-week consultation exercise before deciding if part two of the Leveson Inquiry into the regulation of the British press should go ahead. Part One of the inquiry by Lord Justice Leveson studied the culture and ethics of newspapers. Part two is due to probe deeper into wrong-doing in the press and police. The Culture Secretary Karen Bradley also announced that the Government will consult on whether to implement legislation which would force newspapers to pay all of the costs of libel or privacy actions brought against them, even if they win the case. First she talked about what had been achieved in Part1 of the Leveson Inquiry. Part one made numerous recommendations, all of which are being addressed by the police, her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and the College of Policing, where they relate to them. Given the extent of these criminal investigations, the implementations of the recommendations from part one of the Levenson Inquiry, and the cost to the taxpayer of the investigations of Part One, which is £43] million and {5.1+ million respectively, the Government is considering whether undertaking part two is still in the public interest. We are keen to take stock and seek the views of the public and interested parties, not least those who have been victims of press abuse. We are determined that a balance is struck between press freedom and the freedom of the individual. Those who are treated improperly must have redress. Likewise, politicians must not seek to muzzle the press or prevent it doing legitimate work, such as holding us to account. And the police must take seriously its role in protecting not only its reputation, but also those people it is meant to serve. This is the balance we wish to strike and this consultation is the most appropriate and fairest way of doing so. I commend this statement to the House. Tom Watson. Mr Speaker, what a sad day this is. At least I’m grateful to the Secretary of State for giving me an advance copy of her statement an hour ago. 947 days after all parties reached an agreement to implement the recommendations of the inquiry in full. The prime problem is the investigation into how phone hacking conducted. In effect, she is today announcing a consultation on whether the cover-up should be covered up. And it is my view that the events of the past five years make Levenson Part Two more urgent, not less. Let’s remind ourselves of the parents of Milly Dowler and the other victims press intrusion. What is their view of these proposals? Do they think it passes the Prime Minister’s test? Are we protecting the people who have been caught up and absolutely thrown to the wolves? I also believe in a free press and also a responsible press. Would she not agree one of the virtues of the inquiry is it took the whole issue, this whole contentious issue out of the hands of politics and by going with this consultation to which she will respond she is in danger of embroiling a political issue again and low-cost arbitration has to be part of the solution? Does the Secretary of State understand the difficulties local newspapers face and recognises the majority of the press, especially the regional press in Scotland, was not involved in the sort of practice which prompted the Levenson recommendations. It is important that we must balance respect for freedom of the press and the public desire for high standards, accuracy and transparency. In considering how best to proceed, would she take account of the significant deterioration in the economic health of traditional media, which has taken place even since Levenson and is still leading to the closure of titles both national and local level? will she bear in mind the real media giants of today, like Facebook and Google are outside the scope of legislation and regulation altogether? Do the right thing on behalf of the victims, commence the legislation that this House at the House of Lords have already passed and do the right thing by the victims. What I said is we are going to consult. It is a ten week consultation, it is clearly about part two of the Leveson Enquiry... Karen Bradley. The Home Secretary Amber Rudd has been accused of protecting the legacy of Margaret Thatcher by rejecting an inquiry into policing at the Orgreave cokeworks in South Yorkshire, during the year-long miners’ strike in 1984. The charge, from Labour’s Dennis Skinner, came during an acrimonious urgent question on the issue in the House of Commons. Campaigners for a public inquiry into the so-called Battle of Orgreave say \"the gloves are off\" - and they’ll seek a judicial review of the decision. An angry exchange then followed on where blame lay in the miners’ strike. Ultimately, there were no deaths or wrongful convictions. In addition, the police landscape and the wider criminaljustice system have changed fundamentally since 1984. with significant changes in the oversight of policing at every level, including major reforms to criminal procedure, changes to public order policing practice, stronger scrutiny and greater local accountability. The minister attended a positive meeting with campaigners in early September. We were left with a clear impression it was notjust whether there would be an enquiry, it was what form it was going to take. Indeed, the next day the Times reported on the front page Whitehall sources saying that there would be an enquiry. Did the Home Secretary or her advisors authorise this briefing? What changed after it was given? In retrospect does the Minister now concede it was utterly cruel to give those campaigners false hope in that way? Yesterday we were hit with a bombshell but today, we dust ourselves down and we give notice to this government... We will never give up this fight. STUDIO: Angry exchanges followed over where blame lay in the miners’ strike. | support the Home Secretary’s decision. Unlike most of the people opposite bleating, I actually lived in South Yorkshire in a mining community at the time of the miners’ strike and saw first-hand the bullying and intimidation that went on from the miners, people who did not contribute to the strike had their windows done in. They were trying to bring down the democratically elected government of the time and they lost and they need to get over, they need to get over it. Does the Minister understand the Orgreave campaigners feel they have been led up the garden path by the Home Secretary? Does the Minister understand that the Home Secretary’s proposition that because there were no deaths, because there were no convictions and the case has only collapsed because of collusion by South Yorkshire officers was revealed, but because there were no deaths and because there were no convictions injustice must stand 7 On this side of the House we say to ministers and we will not let this issue go and that injustice will not be allowed to stand. Some of us did not read accounts of the miners’ strike from the benefits of living in London and an account in the Guardian. Some of us were there on a daily basis reporting, as l was for Central Television. Can I completely and totally agree with the very sensible decision of the Home Secretary? If we were to have an enquiry, would my honourable friend agree that it might be in to the funding for the activities of the National Union of Mineworkers, who on an almost daily basis thrust thousands of their members into the county of Nottinghamshire, not only to bring down a democratically elected government, but also to thwart the democratic decision of the miners of Nottinghamshire to work. There was a very important issue raised and it is this, the alleged political interference by the then UK government in operational policing. If political interference from the Government took place in operational policing this would be a deeply troubling matter and one of huge constitutional significance. Did the Home Secretary give this grave accusation consideration as part of the process in leading to her decision? We now know that the Thatcher government was going to close 75 pits and not 20. The truth is that this nasty party has now become the nasty government, that is more concerned about preserving the Thatcher legacy than it is fighting for truth and justice. Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would say to the honourable gentleman that I think again actually he has interestingly interpreted what I have been saying. What I have said very clearly is the decision about not having a public enquiry is based on a look in the wider public interest, including issues such as no wrongful convictions, no deaths and importantly the change in structural behaviour partly by Labour government but also prominently by this government as well. STUDIO: The Home Office Minister, Brandon Lewis. Now, say the name Martin Luther King and you probably think of his famous \"I have a dream\" speech from 1963. Much less remembered about the legendary American civil rights leader is the visit he made to Britain four years later. Martin Luther King was given an honorary doctorate in civil law, at Newcastle University. In fact, Newcastle was the only British university to award Dr Luther King an Honorary Degree. Five months later, his life came to a brutal end when he was shot dead in Memphis. Dr Luther King’s 1967 visit has been the subject of a brief Westminster Hall debate. Doctor King held people spellbound as he spoke of his struggle for racialjustice and, and | quote, the three urgent and indeed great problems that we face, not only in the United States of America, but all over the world today. Only someone like Martin Luther King could help me, help give me the inspiration to dream that I could one day be a Member of Parliament for my hometown. And when the three great problems of racism, war and poverty are still all too real for millions of people, I believe we all have a responsibility to take forward Dr King’s legacy. And to mark the upcoming 50 year anniversary of the degree ceremony, Freedom City 2017 will be celebrated across Newcastle and Gateshead. As he beautifully put it, when he said, \"it may be true that the law cannot change the heart, but it can \"restrain the heartless.\" \"It may be true that the law cannot make a man \"love me, but it can restrain him from lynching me.\" This is why on this side we push so much for equality legislation to move forward and continue to move forward until we have true equality in the world. It is important we begin to commemorate the visit one of the greatest African Americans, Martin Luther King and his visit to Newcastle nearly 50 years ago. Martin Luther King came to Newcastle on the 13th of November in 1967, as the honourable lady said, to accept an honorary degree as a doctor of civil law. It was given to him by the University. I think in Britain we can claim to be a successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith country, and in recent years members of African and Caribbean communities have achieved in many different areas, in business, sport, the arts, in government, and in this House. We know in that context that we still have a very long way to go. Remembering Martin Luther King. You’re watching our round-up of the day in the Commons and the Lords. Still to come... will it be easy, or difficult, to strike new trade deals with Australia? Now, you mayjust possibly have noticed, this summer’s referendum on Britain’s continued EU membership resulted in victory for Leave. But did the Leave campaign win fairly and squarely? Some politicians take the view the public were being fed highly exaggerated and even false information. A committee’s now looking at the lessons of the EU Referendum. At its latest session, Labour’s Paul Flynn first recalled some of the claims made during the 2011 Referendum on whether we should have a different electoral system, the Alternative Vote, at general elections. I don’t know if you were here when I mentioned the prominent poster that I saw on Vauxhall Bridge which said that Alternative Vote would cost money therefore the Government will cut the amount of money they give to special baby units in hospitals and cut the protective equipment that our soldiers in Afghanistan were using. Your memory is defective, sir. It said no such thing. Yes, it did. It said no such thing. Oh, no, no, no, no. My memory is perfectly right. I passed this daily on my way into work. If you are referring back to the AV referendum in 2011, firstly your memory is defective, I never signed off a poster... Order, order, order. You have asked the question. l have got in front of me, he needs a bullet-proof vest, not an Alternative Vote system. Correct. That is can advert that you put out. Yes. Suggesting that anyone voting for AV wants to imperil the lives of our soldiers in Afghanistan. We were inviting the voter to make a choice. I believe someone once said something about the language of priorities. We were inviting the voters to consider their priorities. which would they rather money was spent on? You are misleading them with an atrocious lie. That’s what this propaganda is. We are encouraging them to vote... You were misleading them. The vote was about improving the quality of our democracy and both sides lied on that. If we take this referendum, are you happy that the public, they were not told that the pound was going to lose 17% of its value, but they were definitely told that there was going to be £350 million extra per week for the health service. Aren’t you ashamed of that? Which... 7 I’m sorry... I do apologise. Mr Elliott. I think I would defend every aspect of the Vote Leave campaign. If you take the issues in turn. The issue about the 350 million. The point we were raising there was basically who controls how taxpayers’ money is spent? Should we depend on the snapshot of a vote for one day based on all kinds of wild propaganda or should it be a decision taken by Government when it’s clear that the results of that vote are and on sober reflection and then the Government should be in charge, not the snapshot of a referendum on one day? I think in this case the Government is going to make the decision about Brexit and Theresa May has been very clear that Brexit does mean Brexit so we will be leaving the European Union. So the Government is implementing the will of the people and we’re happy with that. Isn’t it right that the public when they realised the result of the vote that was taken on the 23rd ofJune should be subject to second thoughts when they realised what its implications are? Idon’t think that should be the case. Idon’t think there should be a second referendum. Here’s what a real person said. Can I ask Mr Norton to answer the question? Mr Flynn, your concern is that a momentous decision of this nature of such importance for blah blah blah was taken on a snapshot single day. You were elected on a snapshot single day, sir. Do you think that your constituents should. . . 7 No, Iwasn’t. l was elected on a snapshot on seven days. l was elected seven times. You know you are only as good as your last... | find that much more convincing and not on the basis of untruths so I am happy to accept my election. Mr Flynn... Can I give you an example of a lorry driver on LBC which I’m sure you listen to...? | listen to them every day. Indeed. Excellent. James O’Brien, the splendid James O’Brien, the lorry driver said, I finally found the backbone to admit that he changed his mind over voting to leave realising the detrimental impact it would have on the life of his 13-year-old son and the evidence of many others who realised they had been lied to. Broken promises, that they had been conned by a single phrase - taking back control. He then said he feels less in control of his life than ever. Isn’t it right that lots of people like this lorry driver would take a mature decision and have second vote when it’s clear what the disasters that lie ahead are? There’s actually evidence to suggest that more people regret voting Remain than regret voting Leave. So actually were the referendum to be run again actually the Leave vote would be higher. Matthew Elliott. Well, staying with matters of leaving the EU, the Government’s post-Brexit plans appeared to suffer a setback last week when the Australian Trade Minister revealed he’d been given advice saying entering trade talks with Britain before Brexit was completed would be illegal. The International Trade Secretary Liam Fox had intended to start negotiating trade deals with states like Australia before the two-year Brexit process comes to an end, thought to be in 2019. The issue surfaced at question-time in the Lords. Does she believe that the process of undertaking negotiations for trading arrangements with all the other countries in the world is going to take place quickly after this country leaves the European Union and is there not a real danger of a very unsatisfactory and dangerous limbo arising in most cases and what is the Government going to do about that? My lords, we are doing absolutely everything we can to achieve a smooth transition with no gap. The Australian Trade Minister told us that he would want to conclude a free trade agreement as quickly as possible after Brexit and this is the UK Government’s position too. Could my noble friend confirm that there is no EU free trade agreement with Australia, that for years they have tried and failed to achieve one, that you don’t need to have a trade agreement in order to trade, and once we have left the European Union we will be able to negotiate a trade without having to satisfy 27 other countries? Why does Germany do far more trade with India while Germany’s a member of the EU than we do, ie the EU is not stopping us, and isn’t it true that the EU leave us open markets with the clout of 27 members which is greater than the clout of one member? All I can say is that the UK remains committed to being a world leader in free trade. will my noble friend tell me what estimate she has made of the additional trade which would be available in value to the United Kingdom by a free trade agreement or agreement under special arrangement with of Australia that is not now available to us as a member of the world’s largest trading community, the European Union? I do not have figures of what might happen. All I can say is that we have about £10 billion worth of trade in goods and services currently with Australia. We are in the fortunate position of having the same legal system, the same language, the same, you know, culture and so on and so forth. And so these are all positives towards actually negotiating a free trade agreement to further enhance what we already have. My lords, can the noble lord the Minister, the noble lady the Minister, confirm that there is nothing to inhibit discussions and indeed agreements on memorandum of understanding over trade even while we are a member of the European Union, and that those memoranda of understanding might well form the basis for trade agreements after we leave? I absolutely agree with the noble lady. Could it be by some quite unimaginable stretch of the imagination that those noble lords who keep moaning about Brexit are trying to justify the dire warnings about what would happen if we did leave? For instance a Third World War. And as the Minister and I come from the fair city of Glasgow would it be appropriate to say to these people, haud your wheesht? Yes, well, I think my noble lord has taken the words right out of my mouth. Now, could these creatures soon be in great demand at the Ministry ofJustice? Eagles are being employed by police in Holland to tackle illegal drones. A number of tests have been conducted since January. Police in Holland say the birds are not in any danger. So could police soon be announcing not so much the eagle has landed as the eagle has taken off? The prospect was raised atJustice Question Time in the Commons. Can smuggling into prisons by drones be stopped? Very pithy question, Mr Speaker. The new threat by drones is a game changer, not just for prisons but for other parts of Government. That is why I am working with ministers across the Government to engage with several manufacturers to find a solution to this problem. I am keeping a close eye on what is happening internationally particularly in Holland where they are using eagles to stop drones and I am sure, Mr Speaker, we will find a solution in the UK that will take off.

A very warm welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers in North America and around the globe. My name’s Mike Embley. Our top stories: Strong resistance, but Iraqi forces finally push inside Mosul. Our correspondent is on the front line. Rocket-propelled grenades have been incoming fora long time. One week to go, and Hillary Clinton tries to change the topic from her e-mails to Donald Trump’s attitude to women. In turn, he is focussing on policy, saying one of his first priorities would be the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. And why the death of a fish-seller in Morocco has prompted huge protests, and the arrests of two police officers. Hello. We begin with Iraq, where two years after the humiliation of being driven out by so-called \"Islamic State,\" government-backed forces have finally entered the city of Mosul. The offensive is now in its third week. It involves pushing hundreds of troops in heavily-armoured vehicles, tanks, and bulldozers towards Iraq’s second largest city. Forces entered the eastern suburb of Gangali, encountering strong resistance from IS fighters along the way. Our correspondent, Ian Pannell, and cameraman Darren Conway are on the front line, from where they sent this report. To the east, the warm glow of an autumn morning in Iraq. The dawn of a new day built on the hope of a brighter future. But to the west, a reminder of the bloodshed and madness that has cursed this country for years. The sky over Mosul. The troops have just advanced closer to the city of Mosul. We have heard a whizzing sound overhead which is the sound of sniper fire or certain gunfire coming in from Islamic State and the troops have just come down, they are now trying to respond and stop the shooting coming in. Few expected they would advance this far, this fast. But the closer they get to Mosul, so the resistance only grows. Even so, the war machine rolls on, relentlessly. Thousands of soldiers slowly taking back the land of the so-called caliphate. And in the face of an advancing army with only a simple piece of white cloth to defend themselves, more than a million people, trapped between two warring sides. This is the moment Iraqi troops finally entered Mosul. It’s taken almost 2.5 years to get here and the so-called Islamic State was waiting for them. 0n the skyline, we saw two suspected fighters, barely aware that the troops were advancing. And then this... Four militants run across the alley. Armed and dangerous, ready to defend the city and to fight to the death. And that’s what’s happened. Nothing short of all-out war. It’s hard to overstate how dangerous today was. A brutal, terrifying battle that will shape the future of Iraq and the threat of Islamic State to the world. The counterterrorism forces have been moving through Mosul, the outskirts only, for the last few hours, and they’ve met incredibly stiff resistance. We have seen a number of ISIS fighters moving around, carrying rocket repel grenades, there have been incoming attacks... RAPID GUNFIRE. ..and a lot of gunfire. The ground... The ground is treacherous. It is laced with IEDs and itjust illustrates how hard and difficult this final stage of the battle is going to be. This is just day one inside Mosul. This is the road the troops must now take, straight to the city centre. A dark and dangerous journey into the heart of the caliphate of Islamic State. Ian Pannell, BBC News, Mosul. Mosul is home to more than a million people, who’ve been living under IS control for the last two years. IS has banned satellite dishes and mobile phones, making communication with the outside world difficult. But some residents have risked their lives to make contact with a radio station in Northern Iraq. Our correspondent Orla Guerin has been listening in to their calls. A snapshot of Mosul - silent, besieged, braced for the assault. See how IS have hidden an anti-aircraft gun under a bridge. A resistance group, called the Mosul Brigades, secretly recorded these images recently. Others are resisting by daring to speak. The airwaves of Alghad radio station, meaning tomorrow, are open to callers from inside Mosul. But ringing in is high risk. The jihadis have been killing people, just for having a phone. We can’t say where the station is located or identify the staff, they’ve received death threats from IS or Daesh. Wejoin the presenter in studio as listeners phone in to answer our questions. Callers say they are in danger, notjust from IS, but also from air strikes by the US and its allies. Off-air, another caller told us many in the city were waiting fora chance to take revenge on thejihadis. He said life was unbearable and he had to speak out, whatever the risk. And, God forbid, if they discovered you making this call, what would happen, do you think? The station says these days it’s getting more calls from Mosul, a sign that the captive city is recovering its voice. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Northern Iraq. In a week’s time, America will be electing a new President. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have been shuttling across the country, visiting key battleground states in the race for votes. Our North America editor, Jon Sopel, reports on the two campaigns in the final stretch. All our Presidents! Wow, whoa! Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both launched their campaigns injune, June 2015 that is, and they have been going at it ever since. Now there is just one week to go. CHEERING. This is where the marathon turns into a sprint as the candidates hurtle around campaigning in the handful of states that will determine selection. They are the key swing states of Florida and North Carolina in the south and Ohio and Pennsylvania in the industrial north. For Donald Trump to have a path to victory, he needs to win all four but successive polls suggest Hillary Clinton has comfortable leads in both North Carolina and Pennsylvania. And that is why in the race for the keys to the White House, Donald Trump may have momentum but Hillary Clinton is still ahead where she needs to be. The key battleground of Florida played host to Hillary Clinton again today. No mention of e-mails, she wanted to turn the attention back to Donald Trump and his suitability for high office. If you have a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president, who insults more than half the population of the United States of America. And what about our boys? This is not someone we, we want them looking up to. But will the latest e-mail scandal hurt her in those key swing states? All politicians have mixups, I think she is doing her best to be honest. I still trust her. I really think this is hurting her, especially so close to the election. I think there’s a ready been a lot of doubt, really, this whole campaign season. This isn’t helping anything. And that is what Donald Tmmp is hoping for. He was in Pennsylvania today, talking policy. In particular, his plan to repeal and replace the health reforms introduced by Barack Obama. It will be such an honour for me, for you and for everybody in this country because ObamaCare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. But for some of the electorate, these pledges may not make a difference. In many states, early voting has already started. It is estimated around 24 million Americans have already voted. That’s about 20% of the likely turnout, and the figures of registered Republicans and Democrats going to vote shows a slight edge for Hillary Clinton. In trying to explain this race, American political pundits have started to use the phrase of the British Prime Ministerfrom the 19605. Harold Wilson’s comments that a week is a long time in politics. In this helter-skelter white knuckle ride, indeed it is and who knows what’s going to happen next. Jon Sopel, BBC News, Washington. Our correspondent, Laura Trevelyan, joins us from Washington. As we saw in the report, today, Hillary Clinton was in Florida, the 14th time she has been there in a week. There are 29 votes in Florida in the electoral college. Remember, you need to get the 270 votes or more in that all-important college to get to the White House. Now Hillary Clinton knows that while she does have other paths to the White House which could allow her to lose Florida, just about, Donald Trump has to win Florida absolutely. What you can see in the states she is visiting, she has to cut Donald Trump off at the knees and defend her own position at the same time. Her surrogates are on the line for her. Hillary Clinton is worried about African-American turnout in Florida not being as great as it was for Barack Obama in 2008- 2012. Donald Trump is off to states which looked to be solidly Democratic. He was in Pennsylvania earlier today and also wins constant. If he wants to win the White House he has to win these states and be competitive. That is what he is trying to do. And he is certainly forcing Hillary Clinton to spend money again in Michigan and so on where she was in before. It is fascinating. It is like a game of chicken. Donald Trump is talking about private polls showing them on the march in the blue states. You have to think, when you look at the polls, the FBI has done Hillary Clinton no help. There’s plenty more on the US election our website and mobile app. We’ve got live updates, including a look at what the polls are predicting, and commentary from our correspondents in America.

The man was crushed to death in a rubbish truck as he tried to retrieve fish confiscated by police. Greg Dawson reports. CROWD CHANTING. A peaceful protest to honour a fish seller who suffered a violent death. The signs bear the name of Mouhcine Fikri and promised to fight for his memory. This unverified video claims to show the moment before the 31-year-old was crushed to death as he tried to retrieve his stock of swordfish that was confiscated by police. Officials say it illegal to fish at this time of year. Witnesses claimed to have heard an officer give the order to start the rubbish compressor with Mouhcine Fikri trapped inside. Over the weekend, the anger fanned out across Morocco. For many, this death has become the symbol of a wider sense of injustice in the country. TRANSLATION: We are not here only for Mouhcine Fikri. People feel humiliated. Many Moroccans from different social classes already took to the streets. It’s a real uprising against the system of humiliation and belittling of the situation we are living in. In a country with high unemployment and poverty rates, many accuse state authorities of abusing their power. Morocco’s Interior Minister condemned the death and 11 people have been arrested. They include five local officials from the city of Al-Hoceima where the incident occurred. They’re accused of involuntary manslaughter and forgery of public documents. Moroccan authorities will be wary of the echoes of 2011 when a Tunisian street vendor set himself alight after his goods were confiscated by authorities. His suicide became the catalyst for uprisings across North Africa, including protests in Morocco. Political and economic reforms followed and the Moroccan Royal Family gave the government greater powers. Five years later and officials will hope these arrests go some way to diminishing a new wave of anger in this country. The South Korean president, Park Geun-Hye, has replaced her Prime Minister and finance minister, as she attempts to contain a political scandal involving one of her friends. The woman, Chay Soon-sil, is suspected of exerting influence over the president forfinancial gain. She has been detained because of fears she may try to flee the country. However, it’s not clear whether the outgoing ministers were sacked or chose to leave, nor whether they are implicated in the scandal. In Japan they are watching closely to see what the US election will mean for the alliance between the two countries. Since World War II the US has had tens of thousands of troops in Japan. Donald Trump says that should end. The BBC’s Rupert Wingfield-Hayes has been to the island of Okinawa. 15 US fighterjets roar into the sky above the Japanese island of Okinawa. For 70 years this little island in the far south of Japan has been America’s unsinkable aircraft carrier in Asia. I’m now standing on the south-west coast of Okinawa. This beside me is the East China Sea. If you take the drone up... That, off to the west, is the giant Kadena Air Base, the largest US air force facility in the Western Pacific. And if we take the drone to the north, on top of that hill is the Futenma Marine Corps base. The US presence here on Okinawa is enormous and, as Donald Trump likes to remind us, it is also extremely expensive. There are nearly 50,000 US personnel based inJapan and another 25,000 Japanese working on these US bases. In the first presidential debate, MrTrump said: Is that true? Masaharu Shimanaka is chairman of the Okinawa Garrison force’s labour union. Does he think they are getting a free ride on the US taxpayer? TRANSLATION: Trump really has no clue. The Japanese government is paying to lease these areas. Japan also pays the salaries of all the Japanese working on US bases in Okinawa. It even pays the electricity and water bills. Japan pays around US$2 billion every year towards the cost of keeping American forces here. A lot of people in Okinawa want that to stop. These protesters are blocking a truck from getting to a construction site fora new US base. They say the burden of hosting so many US troops here is just too high. So does that mean they support Donald Trump? TRANSLATION: Mr Trump makes lots of radical comments and even talks about removing all the US bases from Okinawa. So I’m a bit hopeful, but at the same time I am worried he will bring trouble if he becomes the US president. TRANSLATION: I guess it’s a good thing. But when you listen to what he says, I have a big question about him. I worry he might violate human rights. I worry if he is going to make the right decision as a human being. These people may want the US to go, but that does not mean they want Donald Trump to be president. IfJapan had a vote it would go to Hillary Clinton.

We say hello to the colder days with sunshine and a return to frosty mornings. During the night most places will be clear. Cloud clearing from the south. A few showers affecting northern Scotland and maybe Northern Ireland and northern and western Wales. Under clear skies for most of us, chilly first thing on Wednesday morning. Widespread frost in rural areas with temperatures below freezing. Maybe -2, -4 degrees in some of the Scottish Glens. Wednesday starts on a cold note. Plenty of sunshine around. Some showers affecting the northern quarter of Scotland and the Northern Isles. Maybe the odd heavy one mixed in. But for central, southern Scotland, plenty of sunshine here. Temperatures in low single figures for most. Maybe the odd shower. A patch of cloud for Northern Ireland. Largely dry otherwise with sunny spells. Same for Wales. Certainly, the bulk of Wales and the majority of England starting sunny but cold with temperatures in the low single figures. Through the day, many places enjoying a fine and dry day with lots of sunshine around. A keen wind in northern and eastern areas. It should be dry with a few showers here but most places should stay dry and it will be a chilly day compared to recent days. Nine until maybe 11-12 degrees in the south. It will be a cold night on Wednesday and a cold morning on Thursday. Widespread frost for most of us because Northern Ireland will have a low pressure area. Elsewhere, dry. Plenty of sunshine in central and eastern areas. Cloud will begin as the weather system pushes through. Another cold today. Seven to around 11 or 12 degrees in the south. Friday, that rain spreads on to the south-east. Low pressure pretty much dominating the scene on Friday and into the start of Saturday. As that moves off into the east we open the floodgates again to a northerly winds and fairly tight isobars mean it will be cold and windy as well. There will be sunshine in the forecast. It is not going to be a washout. We will not see a lot of showers. But quite a few in northern and eastern areas. The odd heavy one. I think the best of the dry and bright weather further south and west. But it is going to feel cold in the northerly winds. 7-10 degrees. A few showers again in the northern and eastern coast. But still, a lot of sunshine. 1m Now it is time for Panorama.

It is a political crisis is divided. It is a political crisis caused by corruption. For years, caused by cormption. For years, politicians caused by corruption. For years, politicians and state officials have politicians and state officials have been taking bribes. I never saw my countrymen so angry as in the last couple of years. If you are afraid of losing yourjob and then you watch TV and you see all these guys taking millions of dollars in bribes, you are going to feel angry. Very, very angry. 1m Now the truth is coming out and it Now the tmth is coming out and it doesn’t Now the truth is coming out and it doesn’t look good for Rolls-Royce. It all centres on Brazil’s state oil company. It’s called Petrobras and it’s huge. This gives you a sense of the scale of the Petrobras operation. This facility is just off the coast of Rio. Petrobras is one of the biggest companies in South America. It produces two million barrels of oil every day and it does that using equipment supplied by foreign companies like Rolls-Royce. For Rolls-Royce, this was big business. One contract alone was worth $100 million. But to win contracts like this, companies were paying bribes. This is Pedro Barusco. One of the Petrobras executives who handled the bribes. {[1 He has done a deal and named the companies that paid bribes. This is companies that paid bribes. This is the first time the prosecutor has the first time the prosecutor has spoken about Rolls-Royce and aqua spoken about Rolls-Royce and aqua one. I could point you towards a one. I could point you towards a deep position where he states the deep position where he states the names of several companies that he names of several companies that he received bribes from. One of those received bribes from. One of those companies is Rolls-Royce. And companies is Rolls-Royce. And Bamsco companies is Rolls-Royce. And Barusco told the authorities about Bamsco told the authorities about that Barusco told the authorities about that $100 million contract. that $100 million contract. Rolls-Royce made some payments. He Rolls-Royce made some payments. He does not remember exactly who does not remember exactly who benefited from the division of benefited from the division of bribes, but remembers he got at bribes, but remembers he got at least 200 thousand dollars US. The least 200 thousand dollars US. The Rolls-Royce bribes were paid by a Rolls-Royce bribes were paid by a middleman. It was the standard way middleman. It was the standard way of moving the corrupt money. with the foreign companies, the most common means to pay bribes would be to hire a consultant. And that person would be responsible to deliver the money to Petrobras directors or the politicians. Prosecutors in Brazil say Rolls-Royce is cooperating. But its reputation here has been badly damaged. What do you think then of a company like Rolls Royce that’s paying bribes to get contracts? I think they are a big part of the problem. Perhaps even a bigger part than the Brazilian companies, in the sense that, come on, we’re talking about very rich companies, you know, very powerful. They operate everywhere across the globe. So they come to Brazil to do that? They are just like the bad companies in Brazil. I mean, that’s awful. So how has Rolls-Royce ended up in this position? The company doesn’t make cars anymore, that was sold to BMW. This promotional video shows what Rolls-Royce is famous for now - building engines for aircraft. It employs 23,000 people in the UK. Every day aircraft are taking off with British wings, British landing gear, Rolls-Royce engines. We can be incredibly proud of this industry. Up until a couple of years ago, growth was spectacular. In 15 years the company’s sales tripled. Profits increased five fold. Rolls-Royce is that sort of great British tradition of engineering British tradition of engineering excellence, which I think people excellence, which I think people really respect. It’s a respected and trusted brand. The company’s been through phenomenal growth. It entered into new markets. It went into new geographic territories and it became a real global power. But serious questions are being asked aboutjust how Rolls-Royce managed to grow so quickly. Alongside the Guardian newspaper, we’ve been investigating the company. We’ve got evidence that Rolls-Royce was using dubious middlemen to win contracts in countries where corruption is widespread. One of Britain’s most prestigious companies was bribing its way around the world. In 2013, the Serious Fraud Office in the UK started investigating the way Rolls Royce had won contracts for jet engines. A former Rolls-Royce employee claimed big bribes had been paid in Indonesia. He said $20 million was given to the former President’s son, Tommy Suharto, to make sure Indonesia’s main airline used Rolls-Royce engines. The fact that there is credible evidence from inside the company, that the company is paying bribes to people very closely linked to senior politicians, suggests in all instances prima facie evidence of corruption. Tommy Suharto has denied the allegations. But in 2011, a second whistleblower using the cover name \\'Soaring Dragon’ suggested Rolls-Royce had paid bribes to win contracts at two airlines in China. According to Soaring Dragon, a middleman paid bribes to a Chinese airline executive. The Chinese authorities investigated and the airline executive involved was convicted of taking bribes. Now he has been jailed for life. But no action has been taken against Rolls-Royce. Crucial parts of the case have been kept secret, including the name of the company paying the bribes. But Rolls Royce secured contracts worth $2 billion from two Chinese airlines in the same period that the bribes were paid. If one puts the information that we have been able to glean from the court case in which someone was sentenced to a life term for corruption, if we look at the sort of aircraft involved, the sorts of engines that that aircraft uses, if we look at the allegations made by Soaring Dragon, that were instrumental to this court case, all of those things together point to Rolls-Royce. Rolls-Royce says it’s \"fully co-operating\" with the authorities and cannot comment on \"ongoing investigations\". It says it \"completed a thorough review\" of its anti-corruption policies, including \"the use of advisers and intermediaries\". Rolls-Royce has sold equipment in some of the most corrupt countries on the planet. It used middlemen to help. I’ve come to the south of France to meet someone who knows how it works. Right now, I’m probably the only guy that’s stepping up to the plate and kind of giving you an inside look from my perspective on how it worked when l was there. Lindsey Mitchell used to work for a Monaco-based company called UNAOIL. It’s also under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. You know, you became the guy that had the connections. UNAOIL worked for Rolls-Royce in countries like Iraq, Angola, and Kazakhstan. Just beyond this Fedex truck on the right hand side is the UNAOIL office. Just down there? Yeah. Right in there. This is the first time Lindsey’s talked about the corruption he saw when he worked here. Strange to see it again? Very strange. He’s about to make an extraordinary confession. He bribed an oil official to try to help a client win business. Idon’t call it a bribe, I call it a facility payment or a commission but in layman terms it would be called a bribe. I, uh, made the payment at the gentleman’s house at 11 o’clock at night. Dropped it off. How heavy was the envelope? Thick. Thick with money? Yep. What did you say? It’s - Ijust dropped off and here’s your gift, yeah. And what did he say? Thank you and let’s have a coffee. So we had a coffee. And that’s it? That’s it. That’s how it works. That’s how it works. But Unaoil was happy to pay that bribe? They were happy to pay the facility payment. Rolls-Royce wasn’t one of Lindsey’s clients. But he believes UNAOIL paid bribes for Rolls-Royce too. If they were representing Rolls Royce, it would be Unaoil’s responsibility to make sure that the commissions and facility payments, and or if you want to call them bribes, were made to the proper officials to make the uh the sale. Wouldn’t it be reasonable then for Rolls Royce to say look we went to UNAOIL to get us work, We don’t know what they were doing? They had to have known. They would have known. Someone within the management of Rolls-Royce or any other company that Unaoil represented knew there was facility payments or commissions being paid to get business. Just the way it works. There’s evidence that appears to support what Lindsey is saying. UNAOIL emails, that were leaked to the Fairfax Media group, suggest paying bribes was commonplace. And some involve Rolls-Royce. This document shows UNAOIL put aside $284,000 for middlemen, or sub-agents, on a Rolls-Roycejob in Iraq. And this email shows how gifts were bought for an official involved with the contract. Mr X is our key contact to obtaining the current contract valued at $17 million and I am pursuing him hard for the next set of turbines valued in excess of $23 million. The emails show that UNAOIL took the official shopping in London, spending more than $2,000 on luxury goods. They even spell out why they’re doing it. Spending $2,684 on a key decision maker is worth 100 times that value, without which we would have no contract in our hands now. The value ofjacket starts to show now. Spending $2700 on a key decision maker is worth 100 times that value without which we would have no in our hands now. These are all internal UNAOIL emails aren’t they? That’s right, yeah. They refer to people who were working on Rolls-Royce accounts. We showed the evidence to a bribery expert. The email is describing gifts entirely intended to secure business. when there’s quite clearly er stated the object of giving the gifts is to get access to a decision maker who might otherwise not favour your business, then it plainly is intended to induce a positive decision. Some of the numbers are quite small, just over $2000, things like leather jacket - it seems very small amounts. It doesn’t matter. What matters is the purpose for which the gift is given. If the expectation is, and plainly what these emails reveal, is that there was - these things were done with a clear expectation of business being granted, that’s bribery. Unaoil told us any allegations of corruption are denied and it would be inappropriate to make further comment because of the ongoing investigation. The company looks forward to speaking out on this in the fullness of time. Rolls-Royce faces questions around the world about the way it does business. Some of the biggest are here in India. Rolls-Royce has already been caught out here. In 2014, it offered to pay back 3 £1.8 million commission that it had secretly paid to a middle-man. Rolls-Royce offered to return the money it had paid in those deals. Is the suggestion there were bribes involved? Why was the agent paid that kind of money if it was not something illegal? The most serious questions relate to the biggest deals. And for Rolls-Royce they are often defence contracts. No big defence deal takes place without money changing hands. Defence deals are big deals. Mostly small ticket items, building a bridge here or a road here. when you come to defence, you get into multi-billion dollars, $10 billion, $5 billion. So the payoffs there are huge. MAJESTIC MUSIC Rolls-Royce supplies engines for the Hawkjet, used by the Red Arrows. The Indian government bought 123 of them, and that earned Rolls-Royce around £400 million. David Cameron was in India to celebrate. It is just one of Rolls-Royce’s defence deals in India. And once again, they are said to involve a secretive middle-man. He’s a London-based billionaire who has built a business empire. Sudhir Choudhrie. Here he is picking up a business achievement award from Theresa May. The entire community was there. The Asian community and everyone was very delightful. The Choudhrie family has given more than £1.6 million to the Liberal Democrats. And Mr Choudhrie is now an adviser on India to party leader Tim Farron. He is a most important defence agent in India, and he’s among the most powerful today. He is a globalfigure. We are talking about billions of dollars of money worth of deals. But Sudhir Choudhrie was not registered as a defence agent in India. It is illegal to pay secret middlemen to win defence contracts, but that seems to be what Rolls-Royce was doing. when a defence scam surfaced in this country, the ministry and the government banned agents, and they said companies have to deal through recognised offices opened in the country. They are not allowed to deal through these little agents and, you know, who represent opportunities for unseen diversion of funds. A man who knows India’s murky world of agents agreed to meet me. He wanted to remain anonymous. But what he told us links Sudhir Choudhrie to both Rolls-Royce and the Hawk deal. Does Sudhir Choudhrie work for Rolls-Royce? l was approached by someone from the Sudhir Choudhrie team in India. They wanted an introduction to government. It was to do with the Hawk deal. They were representing Sudhir Choudhrie, it was very clear. Why would Rolls-Royce hire such a guy? Why does it need a consultant with a shady background? Panorama understands Rolls-Royce secretly paid around £10 million to companies owned by the Choudhrie family. Now, Mr Choudhrie denies being paid by Rolls-Royce. But he hasn’t answered our question about payments going to family companies. We’ve also found out what the Indian authorities think of Mr Choudhrie. Rolls-Royce’s man in India is officially suspected of corrupt or irregular practises. We’ve got hold of the government’s secret list of Undesirable Contact Men. Now, it warns civil servants and government ministers to take extra care when dealing with such unscrupulous persons. Sudhir Choudhrie is on that list. It is a blacklist of men with whom government employees and officials should not deal with. Men who should not been given any contracts, and Sudhir Choudhrie has had a very prominent position in the list for years. Why is he on the list? For the fact he’s known and accused of manipulating defence procurement. So why was Rolls-Royce involved with someone like Sudhir Choudhrie? Fora company like Rolls-Royce to be using, as a middle-man, somebody who clearly has a very poor reputation, suggests that they have very few scruples about the way they go about their practise of business in India. Mr Choudhrie’s lawyers told us: 0n the Undesirable Contact Men list, they said he has no knowledge of its content. In 2014, Sudhir Choudhrie was arrested in the UK as part of that Serious Fraud Office investigation into Rolls-Royce. His son, Bhanu Choudhrie, was arrested too. Both men were released without charge. They both own houses in this exclusive London square. We have found evidence that suggests Bhanu Choudhrie may have helped Rolls-Royce win that multi-million pound Hawk deal, and it involves paying what on the face of it looks like a bribe. It centres on this man, Peter Ginger. He played a key role in selling militaryjets with Rolls-Royce engines to the Indian government. We’ve discovered that Mr Ginger visited Switzerland with Bhanu Choudhrie in 2007. He opened a Swiss bank account under the name of Portsmouth. And paid in a large quantity of cash. His account later showed 1 million Swiss francs. A source at the bank agreed to speak to us anonymously. The documents do show one bank account containing hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs opened for Peter Ginger. I understand that Peter Ginger lodged all of this money in one go, in cash, in Switzerland. So, did all that cash have anything to do with Rolls-Royce? We asked Peter Ginger who he was doing in Switzerland with Bhanu Choudhrie, the son of Rolls-Royce’s man in India. Sorry, sir... But he wouldn’t answer the question. So, Mr Ginger, Ithink he’sjust over here. So I caught up with him fora chat. Mr Ginger, hi there. I’m Richard Bilton from BBC Panorama. Can I ask you a quick question? No. I cannot talk to you. You know I can’t talk. Please take me off camera. You put money into your Swiss bank. Was that a bribe? Don’t be ridiculous. Tell me the truth? Did that money come from... lam. Look, you have asked me the questions, it’s now with my lawyer. I’m not answering any questions. My lawyer will answer the questions. You have received a letterfrom him. His lawyer has never contacted us. You haven’t responded. I will not respond. Now... You told us something untrue. You told us you had not been to Switzerland and you have. What did Mr Choudhrie want? Go away. What did he want, sir? I am getting into a taxi. Don’t follow me. Was the money that went into the account a bribe? I am not pushing you. Was the money a bribe, sir? Don’t be ridiculous. l have told you that before. Deal with my lawyer. Mr Ginger told us he has never acted for Rolls-Royce or had any financial dealings with the company. And he says he’s never taken nor paid any bribes. Bhanu Choudhrie’s lawyers told us he’s never been paid to secure deals for Rolls-Royce. Including the sale of Hawk yets. And he has no knowledge of Mr Ginger’s banking arrangements. The serious fraud office now has 30 investigators on the Rolls-Royce investigators on the Rolls-Royce use. There is a separate investigation in the United States. Rolls-Royce could face enormous fines. Employees, past or present, could be jailed. Why should our viewers care if a company like Rolls-Royce, an iconic UK brand, is using middlemen to pay bribes? They should care because Rolls-Royce should be better than that. It is an important brand. It is a brand that should be entirely clean. Rolls-Royce says it will not tolerate business misconduct or inappropriate behaviour of any kind and has intensified its focus on ethics and compliance. It says it has \"zero tolerance\" to bribery and corruption. I think it is extremely unfortunate, the way Rolls-Royce has behaved. I think their business model has been based on the systematic use of agents or middlemen to effectively try and bribe their way to contracts. I think that makes not only the United Kingdom, but the world in which we trade, a more corrupt place. A less democratic place. And a far more volatile and unstable place in which to do business. The golden years for Rolls-Royce seem to be over. The company has issued five warnings about falling profits in the last two years. It is now under scrutiny as never before. Bribing its way around the world is no longer an option for Rolls-Royce. A very warm welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers A very warm welcome to BBC News, broadcasting to our viewers in North America and around the globe. My name’s Mike Embley. Our top stories: Strong resistance, but Iraqi forces finally push inside Mosul. Our correspondent is on the front line. Rocket propelled grenades have been incoming. One week to go, and Hillary Clinton tries to change the topic from her emails back to Donald Trump’s attitude towards women. He is focussing on policy. He repeats again and again one of his first priorities is repealing and replacing Obamacare. And why the death of a fish-seller in Morocco has prompted huge protests and the arrests of two police officers. We begin with Iraq, where two years after the humiliation of being driven out by so-called Islamic State, government-backed forces have finally entered the city of Mosul. The offensive is now in its third week. It involves pushing hundreds of troops in heavily-armoured vehicles, tanks and bulldozers towards Iraq’s second largest city. Forces entered the eastern suburb of Kukjali, encountering strong resistance from IS fighters along the way. Our correspondent Ian Pannell and cameraman Darren Conway are on the front line, from where they sent this report. To the east, the warm glow of an autumn morning in Iraq. The dawn of a new day built on the hope of a brighter future. But to the west, a reminder of the bloodshed and madness that has cursed this country for years. The sky over Mosul. The troops have just advanced closer to the city of Mosul. We have heard a whizzing sound overhead which is the sound of sniper fire or certain gunfire coming in from Islamic State and the troops have just come down, they are now trying to respond and stop the shooting coming in. Few expected they would advance this far, this fast. But the closer they get to Mosul, so the resistance only grows. Even so, the war machine rolls on, relentlessly. Thousands of soldiers slowly taking back the land of the so-called caliphate. And in the face of an advancing army, with only a simple piece of white cloth to defend themselves, more than a million people, trapped between two warring sides. This is the moment Iraqi troops finally entered Mosul. It’s taken almost 2.5 years to get here and the so-called Islamic State was waiting for them. 0n the skyline, we saw two suspected fighters, barely aware that the troops were advancing. And then this... Four militants run across the alley. Armed and dangerous, ready to defend the city and to fight to the death. And that’s what’s happened. Nothing short of all-out war. It’s hard to overstate how dangerous today was. A brutal, terrifying battle that will shape the future of Iraq and the threat of Islamic State to the world. The counterterrorism forces have been moving through Mosul, the outskirts only, for the last few hours, and they’ve met incredibly stiff resistance. We have seen a number of ISIS fighters moving around, carrying rocket repel grenades, there have been incoming attacks... RAPID GUNFIRE ..and a lot of gunfire. The ground...the ground is treacherous. It is laced with IEDs and itjust illustrates how hard and difficult this final stage of the battle is going to be. This is just day one inside Mosul. This is the road the troops must now take, straight to the city centre. A dark and dangerous journey into the heart of the caliphate of Islamic State. Ian Pannell, BBC News, Mosul. The more than a million people still in Mosul have been living under IS control for the last two years. IS has banned satellite dishes and mobile phones, making communication with the outside world difficult. But some residents have risked their lives to make contact with a radio station in Northern Iraq. The BBC’s Orla Guerin has been listening in. A snapshot of Mosul - silent, besieged, braced for the assault. See how IS have hidden an anti-aircraft gun under a bridge. A resistance group, called the Mosul Brigades, secretly recorded these images recently. Others are resisting by daring to speak. The airwaves of Alghad radio station, meaning tomorrow, are open to callers from inside Mosul. But ringing in is high risk. The jihadis have been killing people, just for having a phone. We can’t say where the station is located or identify the staff, they’ve received death threats from IS or Daesh. Wejoin the presenter in studio as listeners phone in to answer our questions. Callers say they are in danger, notjust from IS, but also from air strikes by the US and its allies. Off-air, another caller told us many in the city were waiting fora chance to take revenge on thejihadis. He said life was unbearable and he had to speak out, whatever the risk. And, God forbid, if they discovered you making this call, what would happen, do you think? The station says these days it’s getting more calls from Mosul, a sign that the captive city is recovering its voice. Orla Guerin, BBC News, Northern Iraq. In a week’s time, Americans will be electing a new President. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have been shuttling The states they choose to visit now, in this final stretch, telling you a lot about how they really feel their campaigns are going. Our North America EditorJon Sopel with this report. All our Presidents! Wow, whoa! Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton both launched their campaigns injune, June 2015 that is, and they have been going at it ever since. Now there is just one week to go. This is where the marathon turns into a sprint as the candidates hurtle around campaigning in the handful of states that will determine selection. They are the key swing states of Florida and North Carolina in the south and Ohio and Pennsylvania in the industrial north. For Donald Trump to have a path to victory, he needs to win all four but successive polls suggest Hillary Clinton has comfortable leads in both North Carolina and Pennsylvania. And that is why in the race for the keys to the White House, Donald Trump may have momentum but Hillary Clinton is still ahead where she needs to be. The key battleground of Florida played host to Hillary Clinton again today. No mention of e-mails, she wanted to turn the attention back to Donald Trump and his suitability for high office. If you have a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president, who insults more than half the population of the United States of America. And what about our boys? This is not someone we, we want them looking up to. But will the latest e-mail scandal hurt her in those key swing states? All politicians have mixups, I think she is doing her best to be honest. I still trust her. I really think this is hurting her, especially so close to the election. I think there’s a ready been a lot of doubt, really, this whole campaign season. This isn’t helping anything. And that is what Donald Trump is hoping for. He was in Pennsylvania today, talking policy. In particular, his plan to repeal and replace the health reforms introduced by Barack Obama. It will be such an honour for me, for you and for everybody in this country because ObamaCare has to be replaced. And we will do it and we will do it very, very quickly. It is a catastrophe. But for some of the electorate, these pledges may not make a difference. In many states, early voting has already started. It is estimated around 24 million Americans have already voted. That’s about 20% of the likely turnout, and the figures of registered Republicans and Democrats going to vote shows a slight edge for Hillary Clinton. In trying to explain this race, American political pundits have started to use the phrase of the British Prime Minister from the 19605. Harold Wilson’s comments that a week is a long time in politics. In this helter-skelter white knuckle ride, indeed it is and who knows what’s going to happen next. Jon Sopel, BBC News, Washington. Ispoke just now with our correspondent Laura Trevelyan, in Washington, about what the candidates’ tactics now, tell us about how they really think things are going. As we saw in the report, today, Hillary Clinton was in Florida, the 14th time she has been there in a week. There are 29 votes in Florida in the electoral college. Remember, you need to get the 270 votes or more in that all-important college to get to the White House. Now Hillary Clinton knows that while she does have other paths to the White House which could allow her to lose Florida, just about, Donald Trump has to win Florida absolutely. What you can see in the states she is visiting, she has to cut Donald Trump off at the knees and defend her own position at the same time. Her surrogates are on the line for her. Hillary Clinton is worried about African-American turnout in Florida not being as great as it was for Barack Obama in 2008-2012. That is what they are trying to do. Donald Trump is off to states which looked to be solidly Democratic. He was in Pennsylvania earlier today and also wins constant. If he wants to win the White House he has to win these states and be competitive. That is what he is trying to do. And he is certainly forcing Hillary Clinton to spend money again in Michigan and so on where she was in before. It is fascinating. It is like a game of chicken. Donald Trump is talking about private polls showing them on the march in the blue states. You have to think, when you look at the polls, the FBI has done Hillary Clinton no favours at all. The race is tightening all the time. There’s plenty more on the US election our website and mobile app. We’ve got live updates, including a look at what the polls are predicting, and commentary from our correspondents in America. Just go to bbc.com/news. Still to come: Why the race for the White House has serious security implications forJapan, and what the Japanese are thinking. Indira Gandhi, ruler of the world’s largest democracy, died today. Only yesterday she’d spoken of dying in the service of her country and said, \"I would be proud of it, every drop of my blood \"would contribute to the growth of this nation\". After 46 years of unhappiness, these two countries have concluded a chapter of history. No more suspicion, no more fear, no more uncertainty of what each day might bring. Booster ignition and liftoff of Discovery, with a crew of six astronaut heroes and one American legend. Enjoying the show is right. This is beautiful. A milestone in human history.

One main headline this our: The first government-backed Iraqi forces enter Mosul - the last stronghold of self-styled Islamic State in the country. More on our top story. Elite Iraqi counter-terrorism troops have seized control of the state TV building in Kukjali, hours after launching an assault on the eastern district. BBC Arabic’s Feras Kilani was with them, as they came under heavy fire from IS. Idllllilill RAPID GUNFIRE CONTINUES CAR HORN BLARES Michael Pregent is a former US military advisor to the Peshmerga in Mosul, and currently Adjunct Fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington. He’s just returned from Iraq, and | asked him what his concerns were, given that five different armed forces are now closing in on Mosul. My concerns are each one of these forces aren’t necessarily concerned about protecting the Sunni population in Mosul and that is evident. With each one of these units that media is embedded with, you will see militia flags, you will see Ya Hussain flags. These sectarian flags send a message to the population in Mosul that we’re not coming to protect you or liberate you, we are coming to exact punishment, and militia leaders are saying this. They are saying, this is revenge for what happened 1400 years ago. This is Qais Khazali of IRGC-backed Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq, a designated terrorist group. And this is al-Mohandes from Kata’ib Hezbollah, another designated terrorist group, working for the IRGC. These messages that are being said by simply flying these flags as forces approach on Mosul do not make the Sunni population in Mosul feel like a liberating force is coming to Mosul. It’s more like an invading force. We are also hearing the approaching forces are detaining any males of military age that are found to be fleeing Mosul. These people may be IS, they may not be. If they are treated badly, if they are disappeared, surely that risk will create a whole new wave of people with a terrible grievance, new extremists. We saw that in Ramadi, Falluja, Tikrit, and we are seeing that now. That is something the Shia militias are very comfortable with. Pulling away the military from the women and children, they’ll take pictures with the women and children for a PR advance, but you’ll see the men led away. Sometimes, there are still disappearances under investigation, they will lead them away and families don’t see them again and that is a major concern. Turkey has made it clear it is massing forces on its border to go in if it feels the Kurds are getting too much leverage. How concerned are you about that and do you have any sense there is anybody with an overview that could exert some control? The United States doesn’t have leverage right now with Turkish forces. They don’t have leverage with the government of Iraq to keep the Shia militias off the battlefield. We do have leverage with the Peshmerga and the Iraqi special operations forces that we’ve trained. Turkey will enter Iraq if it sees the Kurds getting too much territory. They will also enter if they see the Shia militias start to target Sunni Turkmen in Tel Afar. That is a red line for the Turkish military, and they’re positioned close enough to do something about it. 11 people - including two police officers - have been arrested in Morocco over the killing of a fish-seller whose violent death prompted large-scale protests in several cities. The man was crushed to death in a rubbish truck as he tried to retrieve fish confiscated by police. Greg Dawson reports. CROWD CHANTING A peaceful protest to honour a fish seller who suffered a violent death. The signs bear the name of Mouhcine Fikri and promise to fight for his memory. This unverified video claims to show the moment before the 31-year-old was crushed to death as he tried to retrieve his stock of swordfish that was confiscated by police. Officials say it’s illegal to fish at this time of year. Witnesses claim to have heard an officer give the order to start the rubbish compressor with Mouhcine Fikri trapped inside. Over the weekend, the anger fanned out across Morocco. For many, this death has become the symbol of a wider sense of injustice in the country. TRANSLATION: We are not here only for Mouhcine Fikri. People feel humiliated. Many Moroccans from different social classes already took to the streets. It’s a real uprising against the system of humiliation and belittling of the situation we are living in. In a country with high unemployment and poverty rates, many accuse state authorities of abusing their power. Morocco’s Interior Minister condemned the death, and 11 people have been arrested. They include five local officials from the city of Al-Hoceima, where the incident occurred. They’re accused of involuntary manslaughter and forgery of public documents. Moroccan authorities will be wary of the echoes of 2011, when a Tunisian street vendor set himself alight after his goods were confiscated by authorities. His suicide became the catalyst for uprisings across North Africa, including protests in Morocco. Political and economic reforms followed, and the Moroccan Royal Family gave the government greater powers. Five years later, and officials will hope these arrests go some way to diminishing a new wave of anger in this country. The South Korean president, Park Geun-Hay, has replaced her Prime Minister and finance minister. Her latest attempt to contain a political scandal involving one of herfriends. Herfriend, Choi Soon-sil, is suspected of exerting influence over the president for financial gain. She has been detained forfear she may try to flee the country. It’s not clear whether the outgoing ministers were sacked or chose to leave, nor whether they are implicated in the scandal. In Japan they are watching closely to see what the US election will mean for the alliance between the two countries. Since World War II, the US has had tens of thousands of troops in Japan. Donald Trump says that should end. The BBC’s Rupert Wingfield-Hayes has been to the island of Okinawa. 15 US fighterjets roar into the sky above the Japanese island of Okinawa. For 70 years, this little island in the far south of Japan has been America’s unsinkable aircraft carrier in Asia. I’m now standing on the south-west coast of Okinawa. This beside me is the East China Sea. If you take the drone up... ..that, off to the west, is the giant Kadena Air Base, the largest US air force facility in the Western Pacific. And if we take the drone to the north, on top of that hill is the Futenma Marine Corps base. The US presence here on Okinawa is enormous and, as Donald Trump likes to remind us, it is also extremely expensive. There are nearly 50,000 US personnel based inJapan and another 25,000 Japanese working on these US bases. In the first presidential debate, MrTrump said: Is that true? Masaharu Shimanaka is chairman of the Okinawa Garrison force’s labour union. Does he think they are getting a free ride on the US taxpayer? TRANSLATION: Trump really has no clue. The Japanese government is paying to lease these areas. Japan also pays the salaries of all the Japanese working on US bases in Okinawa. It even pays the electricity and water bills. Japan pays around US$2 billion every year towards the cost of keeping American forces here. A lot of people in Okinawa want that to stop. These protesters are blocking a truck from getting to a construction site fora new US base. They say the burden of hosting so many US troops here is just too high. So does that mean they support Donald Trump? TRANSLATION: Mr Trump makes lots of radical comments and even talks about removing all the US bases from Okinawa. So I’m a bit hopeful, but at the same time I am worried he will bring trouble if he becomes the US president. TRANSLATION: I guess it’s a good thing. But when you listen to what he says, I have a big question about him. I worry he might violate human rights. I worry if he is going to make the right decision as a human being. These people may want the US to go, but that does not mean they want Donald Trump to be president. IfJapan had a vote, it would go to Hillary Clinton. And finally... No excuse for these pictures, except they are ridiculously cute. They’re from Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines in Iowa. A new born baby rhino has been having a bath with its mum for the first time. The female rhino, not yet named, pretty soon gets into the spirit of it all and has a great time. She was born last month weighing only nine kilogrammes, one of seven rhinos born in zoos around the world this year. More on that and all of the news any time on the BBC website. And you can get in touch with me and most of the team on Twitter. I’m @BBCMikeEmbley. Thanks for watching. Hello there. We have lost the mild weather, the foggy mornings, and the rather grey days. We say hello to the colder days with sunshine and a return to frosty mornings. During the night, most places will be clear. Cloud clearing from the south. A few showers affecting northern Scotland and maybe Northern Ireland and northern and western Wales. Under clear skies for most of us, chilly first thing on Wednesday morning. Widespread frost in rural areas with temperatures below freezing. Maybe -2, -4 degrees in some of the Scottish Glens. Wednesday starts on a cold note. Plenty of sunshine around. Some showers affecting the northern quarter of Scotland and the Northern Isles. Maybe the odd heavy one mixed in. Plenty of sunshine here. Temperatures in low single figures for most. Maybe the odd shower. A patch of cloud for Northern Ireland. Largely dry otherwise with sunny spells. Same for Wales. Certainly, the bulk of Wales and the majority of England starting sunny but cold with temperatures in the low single figures. Through the day, many places enjoying a fine and dry day with lots of sunshine around. A keen wind in northern and eastern areas. It should be dry with a few showers here but most places should stay dry and it will be a chilly day compared to recent days. 9 to maybe 11-12 degrees in the south. It will be a cold night on Wednesday and a cold morning on Thursday. Widespread frost for most of us because Northern Ireland and Scotland will have a low pressure area. Feeling cold because the winds will be strong. Outbreaks of rain as well. Elsewhere, dry. Plenty of sunshine in central and eastern areas. Cloud will thicken as the weather system pushes through. Another cold day. 7-11 or 12 degrees in the south. Friday, that rain spreads into the south-east. Low pressure pretty much dominating the scene on Friday and into the start of Saturday. As that moves to the east we open the floodgates again to a northerly wind and fairly tight isobars, so it will be cold and windy as well. There will be sunshine in the forecast. It is not going to be a washout. We will not see a lot of showers. But quite a few in northern and eastern areas. The odd heavy one. I think the best of the dry and bright weather further south and west. But it is going to feel cold in the northerly winds. 7-10 degrees. Into Sunday, a few showers across the northern and eastern coast. But still, a lot of sunshine.

You say you love facts, are making? You say you love facts, look at the facts. According to look at the facts. According to statistics composed by the global statistis composed by the global trade statistics composed by the global trade alert, governments took more trade alert, governments took more than 400 to Scrivener tree actions than 400 to Scrivener tree actions against foreign competition twinge against foreign competition twinge any Riyadh August of this year. -- any Riyadh August of this year. -- discriminatory actions.

But, with respect, I looked at what you said respect, I looked at what you said before the vote and before the vote before the vote and before the vote you seemed to be suggesting to the you seemed to be suggesting to the British people that it would if British people that it would if foolhardy to vote to leave and he foolhardy to vote to leave and he suggested that if they did then even suggested that if they did then even trying to establish a relationship, trying to establish a relationship, a new relationship, outside of the a new relationship, outside of the EU with the WTO could take many EU with the WTO could take many years. At one point he said, look, years. At one point he said, look, it took Russia 20 years to negotiate it took Russia 20 years to negotiate a deal. Be aware of how complicated a deal. Be aware of how complicated it is. I never said it was it is. I never said it was foolhardy. You don’t think it was foolhardy. You don’t think it was foolhardy? I think it is up to the foolhardy? I think it is up to the British people to decide. All | foolhardy? I think it is up to the British people to decide. All I said British people to decide. All I said at that time was giving them the at that time was giving them the fax. The facts are, if you pull out, fax. The facts are, if you pull out, don’t ask me what’s going to happen, don’t ask me what’s going to happen, I don’t know. Also don’t tell me I don’t know. Also don’t tell me this is exactly what will happen this is exactly what will happen because nobody knows what is going because nobody knows what is going to happen. Now, negotiations are to happen. Now, negotiations are going to be out there and a lot will going to be out there and a lot will depend on the terms of separation depend on the terms of separation between the UK and EU. That will set between the UK and EU. That will set the stage for a number of other the stage for a number of other negotiations that will have to negotiations that will have to happen. How long it will take, I happen. How long it will take, I don’t know. But the advocates within don’t know.

Absolutely. Everything complicated? Absolutely. Everything is complicated. It is not going back is complicated. It is not going back to be a member of the WTO, the UK to be a member of the M0, the UK never left. to be a member of the WTO, the UK never left. But the UK right now is never left.

They Are they may say, hold on... They could drive a hard bargain. They could drive a hard bargain. They could. One of the leading foreign could. One of the leading foreign affairs commentators in the UK, from affairs commentators in the UK, from the FI’, said affairs commentators in the UK, from the FT, said the danger is that the FI’, said the danger is that after the FT, said the danger is that after Article 50, the two-year after Article 50, the two-year negotiations that is the clock negotiations that is the dock ticking on negotiations that is the clock ticking on the EU - British ticking on the EU - British negotiation to leave, if at the end negotiation to leave, if at the end of those two years Britain, which is of those two years Britain, which is very likely, as negotiated a new very likely, as negotiated a new trading arrangement with the EU, it trading arrangement with the EU, it could fall off a trading cliff. |t could fall off a trading cliff. It will not know quite what its future will not know quite what its future deal or trading arrangement with the deal or trading arrangement with the EU will be and it won’t know what EU will be and it won’t know what its future relationship with other its future relationship with other WTO members is, because you are WTO members is, because you are saying it will actually involve saying it will actually involve negotiation and that negotiation negotiation and that negotiation won’t start until the two years is won’t start until the two years is \"P won’t start until the two years is up so Britain is left with no up so Britain is left with no trading certainty whatsoever. Uncertainty is the name of the game and I have Uncertainty is the name of the game and l have said that all along. We and I have said that all along. We need to and l have said that all along. We need to know what happens. It is need to know what happens. It is tough to speculate. Should the tough to speculate. Should the British people be worried about British people be worried about this? There are distinctions to be this? There are distinctions to be made. One thing I think is clear is made. One thing I think is clear is that Britain is a WTO member and that Britain is a WTO member and will continue to be. In two years, will continue to be. In two years, if the UK and that you don’t have an if the UK and that you don’t have an agreement, there will be a lot of agreement, there will be a lot of uncertainty about the legal basis on uncertainty about the legal basis on which trade is going to be which trade is going to be happening. Idon’t know under what happening. I don’t know under what terms happening. Idon’t know under what terms that will happen. It does not terms that will happen. It does not mean the trade has to cease and stop mean the trade has to cease and stop at that time. It will continue. But at that time. It will continue. But there may be challenges and there may be challenges and uncertainty about what tariff will uncertainty about what tariff will apply with certain partners. The UK apply with certain partners. The UK has 36 free trade agreements with 77 has 36 free trade agreements with 77 partners, which are under partners, which are under preferential terms, negotiated by preferential terms, negotiated by the EU. Once they leave the EU, the EU. Once they leave the EU, those relationships with 77 those relationships with 77 different partners, what is the different partners, what is the basis for that relationship, what basis for that relationship, what kind of tariffs would apply? Would kind of tariffs would apply? Would be under preferential terms or back be under preferential terms or back to WTO turns? What happens? I don’t to WTO turns? What happens? I don’t know what happens. Director-general, know what happens.

Now, even before your environment. Now, even before your time, it is fair to say that the WTO time, it is fair to say that the WTO appeared to have lost its way in appeared to have lost its way in terms of the grand overarching terms of the grand overarching roadmap, the Doha development round, madmap, the Doha development round, the roadmap, the Doha development round, the objective since the beginning of the objective since the beginning of the century to deliver this really, the century to deliver this really, really significant improvement on really significant improvement on free trade arrangements around the free trade arrangements around the world, especially aimed at helping world, especially aimed at helping the least developed countries.

We say hello to the colder days with sunshine and a return to frosty mornings. During the night, most places will be clear. Cloud clearing from the south. A few showers affecting northern Scotland and maybe Northern Ireland and northern and western Wales. Under clear skies for most of us, chilly first thing on Wednesday morning. Widespread frost in rural areas with temperatures below freezing. Maybe -2, -4 degrees in some of the Scottish Glens. Wednesday starts on a cold note. Plenty of sunshine around. Some showers affecting the northern quarter of Scotland and the Northern Isles. Maybe the odd heavy one mixed in. Plenty of sunshine here. Temperatures in low single figures for most. Maybe the odd shower. A patch of cloud for Northern Ireland. Largely dry otherwise with sunny spells. Same for Wales. Certainly, the bulk of Wales and the majority of England starting sunny but cold with temperatures in the low single figures. Through the day, many places enjoying a fine and dry day with lots of sunshine around. A keen wind in northern and eastern areas. It should be dry with a few showers here but most places should stay dry and it will be a chilly day compared to recent days. 9 to maybe 11-12 degrees in the south. It will be a cold night on Wednesday and a cold morning on Thursday. Widespread frost for most of us because Northern Ireland and Scotland will have a low pressure area. Feeling cold because the winds will be strong. Outbreaks of rain as well. Elsewhere, dry. Plenty of sunshine in central and eastern areas. Cloud will thicken as the weather system pushes through. Another cold day. 7-11 or 12 degrees in the south. Friday, that rain spreads into the south-east. Low pressure pretty much dominating the scene on Friday and into the start of Saturday. As that moves to the east we open the floodgates again to a northerly wind and fairly tight isobars, so it will be cold and windy as well. There will be sunshine in the forecast. It is not going to be a washout. We will not see a lot of showers. But quite a few in northern and eastern areas. The odd heavy one. I think the best of the dry and bright weather further south and west. But it is going to feel cold in the northerly winds. 7-10 degrees. Into Sunday, a few showers across the northern and eastern coast. But still, a lot of sunshine. Hello. You’re watching BBC News. I’m Adnan Nawaz. Our top story this hour: Iraqi troops force their way into Mosul. It’s the final major stronghold in Iraq under \"Islamic State\" control. Our correspondent is on the front-line. Rocket propelled grenades have been incoming. Welcome to the programme. Our other main stories this hour: The final furlong. Less than a week now until the US Presidential Election. Both candidates are on the road, campaigning for votes. Why the death of a fish-seller in Morocco has prompted huge protests, and the arrest of two police officers. I’m Sally Bundock.

US coal miners say they won’t vote for Hilary Clinton as she pledges to move away from fossil fuels if she becomes President. In the third week of the biggest military operation in Iraq for years, government forces have fought their way into Mosul, gaining a foothold in the city for the first time since it was taken by the \"Islamic State\" group two years ago. Special Forces entered the eastern suburbs and encountered strong resistance from IS fighters, but they they succeeded in taking control of the State television building. Our international correspondent, Ian Pannell, and cameraman, Darren Conway, were the first broadcastjournalists to enter the district of Kukjali with frontline troops, and they’ve just sent this special report from inside Mosul. To the east, the warm glow of an autumn morning in Iraq. The dawn of a new day built on the hope of a brighter future. But to the west, a reminder of the bloodshed and madness that has cursed this country for years. The sky over Mosul. The troops have just advanced closer to the city of Mosul. We have heard a whizzing sound overhead which is the sound of sniper fire or certain gunfire coming in from Islamic State and the troops have just come down, they are now trying to respond and stop the shooting coming in. Few expected they would advance this far, this fast. But the closer they get to Mosul, so the resistance only grows. Even so, the war machine rolls on, relentlessly. Thousands of soldiers slowly taking back the land of the so-called caliphate. And in the face of an advancing army with only a simple piece of white cloth to defend themselves, more than a million people, trapped between two warring sides. This is the moment Iraqi troops finally entered Mosul. It’s taken almost 2.5 years to get here and the so-called Islamic State was waiting for them. 0n the skyline, we saw two suspected fighters, barely aware that the troops were advancing. And then this... Four militants run across the alley. Armed and dangerous, ready to defend the city and to fight to the death. And that’s what’s happened. Nothing short of all-out war. It’s hard to overstate how dangerous today was. A brutal, terrifying battle that will shape the future of Iraq and the threat of Islamic State to the world. The counterterrorism forces have been moving through Mosul, the outskirts only, for the last few hours, and they’ve met incredibly stiff resistance. We have seen a number of ISIS fighters moving around, carrying rocket repel grenades, there have been incoming attacks... RAPID GUNFIRE. ..and a lot of gunfire. The ground...the ground is treacherous. It is laced with IEDs and itjust illustrates how hard and difficult this final stage of the battle is going to be. This is just day one inside Mosul. This is the road the troops must now take, straight to the city centre. A dark and dangerous journey into the heart of the caliphate of Islamic State. Ian Pannell, BBC News, Mosul. There’s less than a week to go before America elects a new President, and the polls show the race is tightening.

The man was crushed to death in a rubbish truck as he tried to retrieve fish confiscated by police. Greg Dawson reports. CROWD CHANTING. A peaceful protest to honour a fish seller who suffered a violent death. The signs bear the name of Mouhcine Fikri and promised to fight for his memory. This unverified video claims to show the moment before the 31-year-old was crushed to death as he tried to retrieve his stock of swordfish that was confiscated by police. Officials say it illegal to fish at this time of year. Witnesses claimed to have heard an officer give the order to start the rubbish compressor with Mouhcine Fikri trapped inside. Over the weekend, the anger fanned out across Morocco. For many, this death has become the symbol of a wider sense of injustice in the country. TRANSLATION: We are not here only for Mouhcine Fikri. People feel humiliated. Many Moroccans from different social classes already took to the streets. It’s a real uprising against the system of humiliation and belittling of the situation we are living in. In a country with high unemployment and poverty rates, many accuse state authorities of abusing their power. Morocco’s Interior Minister condemned the death and 11 people have been arrested. They include five local officials from the city of Al-Hoceima where the incident occurred. They’re accused of involuntary manslaughter and forgery of public documents. Moroccan authorities will be wary of the echoes of 2011 when a Tunisian street vendor set himself alight after his goods were confiscated by authorities. His suicide became the catalyst for uprisings across North Africa, including protests in Morocco. Political and economic reforms followed and the Moroccan Royal Family gave the government greater powers. Five years later and officials will hope these arrests go some way to diminishing a new wave of anger in this country. Stay with us on BBC News.

We say hello to the colder days with sunshine and a return to frosty mornings. During the night most places will be clear. Cloud clearing from the south. A few showers affecting northern Scotland and maybe Northern Ireland and northern and western Wales. Under clear skies for most of us, chilly first thing on Wednesday morning. Widespread frost in rural areas with temperatures below freezing. Maybe -2, -4 degrees in some of the Scottish Glens. Wednesday starts on a cold note. Plenty of sunshine around. Some showers affecting the northern quarter of Scotland and the Northern Isles. Maybe the odd heavy one mixed in. But for central, southern Scotland, plenty of sunshine here. Temperatures in low single figures for most. Maybe the odd shower. A patch of cloud for Northern Ireland. Largely dry otherwise with sunny spells. Same for Wales. Certainly, the bulk of Wales and the majority of England starting sunny but cold with temperatures in the low single figures. Through the day, many places enjoying a fine and dry day with lots of sunshine around. A keen wind in northern and eastern areas. It should be dry with a few showers here but most places should stay dry and it will be a chilly day compared to recent days. Nine to maybe 11 or 12 degrees in the south. It will be a cold night on Wednesday and a cold morning on Thursday. Widespread frost for most of us because Northern Ireland will have a low pressure area. Elsewhere, dry. Plenty of sunshine in central and eastern areas. Cloud will begin as the weather system pushes through. Another cold today. Seven to around 11 or 12 degrees in the south. Friday, that rain spreads on to the south-east. Low pressure pretty much dominating the scene on Friday and into the start of Saturday. As that moves off into the east we open the floodgates again to a northerly winds and fairly tight isobars mean it will be cold and windy as well. There will be sunshine in the forecast. It is not going to be a washout. We will not see a lot of showers. But quite a few in northern and eastern areas. The odd heavy one. I think the best of the dry and bright weather further south and west. But it is going to feel cold in the northerly winds. 7-10 degrees. A few showers again in the northern and eastern coast. But still, a lot of sunshine. I’m proud to be black. Everybody wants to be us. They want our physicality and our musicality. We are the influencers, the taste makers.

Iraq’s special forces have entered Mosul for the first time since Islamic State militants took control there two years ago. They say they’ll continue their advance to liberate the entire city, although they have encountered fierce resistance from IS fighters. But government troops have so far made more progress than expected and are retaking previously occupied areas.
