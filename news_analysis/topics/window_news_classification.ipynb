       "'But there are varying opinions on economic benefits of faster rail services to Birmingham and Crewe as well as Manchester and Leeds. The debate will continue over whether high-speed rail link really will provide a boost to economic growth long-term in the North of England, orwhether growth long-term in the North of England, or whether it will simply offer more opportunities for commuters to get to London more quickly. I don’t think it will boost the economies of towns in the north. For starters, they face the big tax bill to pay for the project and also the numerous examples both in the North and the Midlands of towns which already have vast buildings to London but fail to be transformed. Today’s report also says the planned link between HS2 and the high-speed rail link to the Channel tunnel should be dropped. Instead, Euston should be redeveloped at the end of the line.'"
